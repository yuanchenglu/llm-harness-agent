Abstract
Large language model (LLM) based agents have recently attracted much attention
from the research and industry communities.   Compared with original LLMs, LLM-
based agents are featured in their self-evolving capability, which is the basis for
solving real-world problems that need long-term and complex agent-environment
interactions.   The key component to support agent-environment interactions is the
memory of the agents. While previous studies have proposed many promising mem-
ory mechanisms, they are scattered in different papers, and there lacks a systemati-
cal review to summarize and compare these works from a holistic perspective, fail-
ing to abstract common and effective designing patterns for inspiring future studies.
To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive survey on the memory
mechanism of LLM-based agents.   In specific, we first discuss “what is” and “why
do we need” the memory in LLM-based agents.   Then, we systematically review
previous studies on how to design and evaluate the memory module. In addition, we
also present many agent applications, where the memory module plays an important
role.   At last, we analyze the limitations of existing work and show important future
directions.   To keep up with the latest advances in this field, we create a repository
at  https://github.com/nuster1128/LLM_Agent_Memory_Survey .

David, a 38-year-old male with a history of allergies and sinus 
infections, has a family history of diabetes and hypertension. As 
a smoker of about one pack a day and an occasional drinker, 
his lifestyle choices may contribute to his health risks. After 
traveling to a tropical country where mosquito-borne illnesses 
are prevalent, he has experienced symptoms such as mild 
fatigue, headache, and muscle aches for the past week. 
For three days, I’ve had a 
fever 
ranging 
from 
100.5 ° F to 102 ° F, a rash 
on my limbs, joint pain 
and swelling, especially 
in my hands, episodes of 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, 
and nausea, leading to a 
loss of appetite.
The patient‘s travel history and 
symptoms suggest dengue fever, 
a mosquito-transmitted illness.

| Finance Yesterday, the financial market underwent significant fluctuations. Equity markets initially slumped as investors responded to weak corporate earnings reports and concerns over global economic growth prospects. Bond yields declined as investors sought safer assets. However, sentiment improved in the afternoon following better-than-expected economic data from a major economy, which boosted investor confidence. As a result, stock prices recovered, and the market closed with modest gains. | The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose by 0.2 percentage points, reaching its highest level in two years. Investors sought safer assets, leading to increased demand for government bonds. Corporate bonds experienced a decline in interest, with their yields rising by 0.15 percentage points. |

Introduction
"Without memory, there is no culture.   Without memory, there would be no civilization, no society, no future."
Elie Wiesel, 1928-2016
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a large number of
domains, ranging from artificial intelligence and software engineering to education and social sci-
ence [ 1 – 3 ].   Original LLMs usually accomplish different tasks without interacting with environments.
However, to achieve the final goal of artificial general intelligence (AGI), intelligent machines should
be able to improve themselves by autonomously exploring and learning from the real world.   For
example, if a trip-planning agent intends to book a ticket, it should send an order request to the ticket
website, and observe the response before taking the next action.   A personal assistant agent should
adjust its behaviors according to the user’s feedback, providing personalized responses to improve
user’s satisfaction.   To further push the boundary of LLMs towards AGI, recent years have witnessed a
large number of studies on LLM-based agents [ 3 ,  4 ], where the key is to equip LLMs with additional
modules to enhance their self-evolving capability in real-world environments.
Among   all   the   added   modules,   memory   is   a   key   component   that   differentiates   the   agents   from
original LLMs, making an agent truly an agent (see  Figure 1 ).   It plays an extremely important role
in   determining   how   the   agent   accumulates   knowledge,   processes   historical   experience,   retrieves
informative knowledge to support its actions, and so on.   Around the memory module, people have
devoted much effort to designing its information sources, storage forms, and operation mechanisms.
For example, Shinn et al.  [5]  incorporate both in-trial and cross-trial information to build the memory
module for enhancing the agent’s reasoning capability.   Zhong et al.  [6]  store memory information in
the form of natural languages, which is explainable and friendly to the users.   Modarressi et al.  [7]
design both memory reading and writing operations to interact with environments for task solving.
While previous studies have designed many promising memory modules, there still lacks a systemic
study to view the memory modules from a holistic perspective.   To bridge this gap,   in this paper,
we   comprehensively   review   previous   studies   to   present   clear   taxonomies   and   key   principles   for
designing and evaluating the memory module.   In specific, we discuss three key problems including:
(1)   what   is   the   memory   of   LLM-based   agents?   (2)   why   do   we   need   the   memory   in   LLM-based
agents?   and (3) how to implement and evaluate the memory in LLM-based agents?   To begin with,
we detail the concepts of memory in LLM-based agents, providing both narrow and broad definitions.
Then,   we   analyze   the   necessity   of   memory   in   LLM-based   agents,   showing   its   importance   from
three perspectives including cognitive psychology, self-evolution, and agent applications.   Based on
the problems of “what” and “why”, we present commonly used strategies to design and evaluate
the memory modules.   For the memory design, we discuss previous works from three dimensions,
that is, memory sources, memory forms, and memory operations.   For the memory evaluation, we
introduce two widely used approaches including direct evaluation and indirect evaluation via specific
agent tasks.   Next, we discuss agent applications including role-playing, social simulation, personal
assistant, open-world games, code generation, recommendation, and expert systems, in order to show
the importance of the memory module in practical scenarios.   At last, we analyze the limitations of
existing work and highlight significant future directions.
The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:   (1) We formally define the mem-
ory module and comprehensively analyze its necessity for LLM-based agents.   (2) We systematically
summarize existing studies on designing and evaluating the memory module in LLM-based agents,
providing clear taxonomies and intuitive insights.   (3) We present typical agent applications to show
the importance of the memory module in different scenarios.   (4) We analyze the key limitations of
existing memory modules and show potential solutions for inspiring future studies.   To our knowledge,
this is the first survey on the memory mechanism of LLM-based agents.
The rest of this survey is organized as follows.   First, we provide a systematical meta-survey for the
fields of LLMs and LLM-based agents in  Section 2 , categorizing different surveys and summarizing
their key contributions.   Then, we discuss the problems of “what is”, “why do we need” and “how
to implement and evaluate” the memory module in LLM-based agents in  Section 3 to 6 .   Next, we
show the applications of memory-enhanced agents in  Section 7 .   The discussions of the limitations of
existing work and future directions come at last in  Section 8  and  Section 9 .

Related Surveys
In the past two years, LLMs have attracted much attention from the academic and industry commu-
nities.   To systemically summarize the studies in this field, researchers have written a lot of survey
papers.   In this section, we briefly review these surveys (see  Figure 2  for an overview), highlighting
their major focuses and contributions to better position our study.
2.1
Surveys on Large Language Models
In   the   field   of   LLMs,   Zhao   et   al.   [70]   present   the   first   comprehensive   survey   to   summarize   the
background, evolution paths, model architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation strategies
of LLMs.   Hadi et al.  [71]  and Min et al.  [72]  also conduct LLM surveys from the holistic view,
which, however, provide different taxonomies and understandings on LLMs.   Following these surveys,
people dive into specific aspects of LLMs and review the corresponding milestone studies and key
technologies.   These aspects can be classified into four categories including the fundamental problems,
evaluation, applications, and challenges of LLMs.
Fundamental   problems .   The   surveys   in   this   category   aim   to   summarize   techniques   that   can
be   leveraged   to   tackle   fundamental   problems   of   LLMs.   Specifically,   Zhang   et   al.   [8]   provide   a
comprehensive survey on the methods of supervised fine-tuning, which is a key technique for better
training LLMs.   Shen et al.  [9] , Wang et al.  [10]  and Liu et al.  [11]  present surveys on the alignment of
LLMs, which is a key requirement for LLMs to produce outputs consistent with human values.   Gao
et al.  [12]  propose a survey on the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capability of LLMs, which
is key to providing LLMs with factual and up-to-date knowledge and removing hallucinations.   Qin
et al.  [18]  summarize the state-of-the-art methods on enabling LLMs to leverage external tools, which
is fundamental for LLMs to expand their capability in domains that require specialized knowledge.
Wang   et   al.   [13] ,   Yao   et   al.   [14] ,   Wang   et   al.   [15] ,   Feng   et   al.   [16]   and   Zhang   et   al.   [17]   present
surveys on the direction of LLM knowledge editing, which is important for customizing LLMs to
satisfy   specific   requirements.   Huang   et   al.   [19] ,   Wang   et   al.   [20]   and   Pawar   et   al.   [21]   focus   on
long-context capabilities of LLMs, which is critical for LLMs to process more information at each
time and enhance their application scenarios.   Wu et al.  [22] , Song et al.  [23] , Caffagni et al.  [24]  and
Yin et al.  [25]  summarize multi-modal LLMs, which expands the capability of LLMs from text to
visual and other modalities.   The above surveys mainly focus on the effectiveness of LLMs.   Another
important aspect of LLMs is their training and inference efficiency.   To summarize studies on this
aspect,   Zhu et al.  [30] , Xu and McAuley  [31] , Wang et al.  [32]  and   Park et al.  [33]  systematically
review the techniques of model compression.   Ding et al.  [81]  and Xu et al.  [29]  analyze and conclude
the studies on parameter efficient fine-tuning.   Bai et al.  [26] , Wan et al.  [27] , Miao et al.  [28]  and
Ding et al. [81] put more focuses on the efficiency of resource utilization in a general sense.
Evaluation .   The surveys in this category focus on how to evaluate the capability of LLMs.   Specifi-
cally, Chang et al.  [34]  comprehensively summarize the evaluation methods from an overall perspec-
tive.   It encompasses different evaluation tasks, methods, and benchmarks, which serve as critical
parts in assessing LLM performances.   Guo et al.  [35]  care more about the evaluation targets and
describe how to evaluate the knowledge, alignment, and safety control capabilities of LLMs, which
supplement evaluation metrics beyond performance.
Applications .   The surveys in this category aim to summarize models that leverage LLMs to improve
different applications.   More concretely, Zhu et al.  [37]  focus on the field of information retrieval
(IR) and summarize studies on LLM-based query processes.   Xu et al.  [38]  pay more attention to
information extraction (IE) and provide comprehensive taxonomies for LLM-based models in this
field.   Li et al. [50], Lin et al. [51] and Wang et al. [52] discuss the applications of LLMs in the field
of recommender system, where they utilize agents to generate data and provide recommendations.
Fan et al.  [39] , Wang et al.  [40] , and Zheng et al.  [41]  concentrate on how LLMs can benefit software
engineering (SE) in terms of software design, development, and testing.   Zeng et al.  [42]  summarize
LLM-based   methods   in   the   field   of   robotics.   Cui   et   al.   [43]   and   Yang   et   al.   [44]   focus   on   the
application   of   autonomous   driving   and   summarize   models   in   this   domain   based   on   LLMs   from
different perspectives.   Beyond the above domains in artificial intelligence, LLMs have also been
used in natural and social science.   He et al.  [45] , Zhou et al.  [46]  and Wang et al.  [47]  summarize the
applications of LLMs in medicine.   Li et al.  [48]  focus on the applications of LLMs in finance.   He
et al. [49] review the models on leveraging LLMs to improve the development of psychology.

Challenges .   The surveys in this category focus on trustworthiness in LLMs, such as hallucination,
bias, unfairness, explainability, security, and privacy.   Hallucination in LLMs refers to the problem
that LLMs may generate misconceptions or fabrications, impacting their reliability for downstream
applications.   Zhang   et   al.   [53] ,   Huang   et   al.   [54] ,   Rawte   et   al.   [55] ,   Ye   et   al.   [56] ,   Ji   et   al.   [57] ,
Tonmoy   et   al.   [58]   and   Jiang   et   al.   [59]   summarize   the   mainstream   models   for   alleviating   the
hallucination problem in LLMs.   The bias and unfairness problems refer to the phenomenon that
LLMs   may   unequally   treat   different   humans   or   objectives,   which   can   lead   to   the   propagation   of
societal   stereotypes   and   discrimination.   Gallegos   et   al.   [60] ,   Kotek   et   al.   [61]   and   Li   et   al.   [62]
comprehensively discuss these challenges and summarize existing methods for alleviating them.   The
problem of explainability means that the internal working mechanisms of LLMs are still unclear.
Zhao et al.  [63]  systematically discuss this problem and summarize previous efforts on improving
the explainability of LLMs.   Security and privacy are also challenging problems, which have been
comprehensively surveyed in Yao et al.  [64] , Shayegani et al.  [65] , Neel and Chang  [66] , Smith et al.
[67], Dong et al. [68] and Das et al. [69].
2.2
Surveys on Large Language Model-based Agents
Based on the capability of LLMs, people have conducted a lot of studies on building LLM-based
agents, which can autonomously perceive environments, take actions, accumulate knowledge, and
evolve   themselves.   In   this   field,   Wang   et   al.   [3]   present   the   first   survey   paper   to   systematically
summarize LLM-based agents from the perspectives of agent construction, agent application, and
agent evaluation.   Xi et al.  [4] , Zhao et al.  [77] , Cheng et al.  [78]  and Ge et al.  [80]  also summarize
LLM-based agent studies from the overall perspective, but they have different focuses and taxonomies,
delivering more diverse understandings on this field.   In addition to these overall surveys, there have
also emerged several papers reviewing specific aspects of LLM-based agents.   For the fundamental
problems, Durante et al.  [79]  summarize studies on multi-modal agents.   Huang et al.  [74]  focus on
the planning capability of LLM-based agents.   Guo et al.  [75]  pay more attention to the scenarios of
multi-agent interactions.   For the applications, Li et al.  [76]  provide a summarization on LLM-based
agents that are leveraged as personal assistants.
Position of this work .   Our survey summarizes the studies on a fundamental problem of LLM-based
agents,   that is,   the agent’s memory mechanism.   To our knowledge,   this is the first survey in this
direction.   We hope it can not only inspire more advanced memory architectures in the future, but also
provide newcomers with comprehensive starting materials.

What is the Memory of LLM-based Agent
Interacting   and   learning   from   environments   is   a   basic   requirement   of   LLM-based   agents.   In   the
agent-environment interaction process, there are three key phases, that is, (1) the agent perceives
information from the environment, and stores it into the memory; (2) the agent processes the stored
information to make it more usable; and (3) the agent takes the next action based on the processed
memory information.   In all these phases, memory plays an extremely important role.   In the following,
we first define the memory of the agent from both narrow and broad perspectives, and then, detail the
execution processes of the above three phases based on the memory module.
3.1
Basic Knowledge
For clear presentations, we first introduce several important background knowledge as follows:
Definition 1  (Task) .   Task is the final target that the agent needs to achieve, for example, booking a
flight ticket for Alice, recommending a restaurant for Bob, and so on.   Formally, we use  T   to represent
a task and label different tasks by subscripts in the following contents.
Definition 2  (Environment) .   In a narrow sense, environment is the object that the agent needs to
interact with to accomplish the task.   For the examples in definition 1, the environments are Alice and
Bob, who provide feedback on the agent’s actions.   More broadly, environment can be any contextual
factors that influence the agent’s decisions, such as the weather when booking flight tickets, the time
and location when recommending restaurants, etc.
Definition 3  (Trial and Step) .   To accomplish a task, the agent needs to interact with the environment.
Usually, the agent first takes an action, and then the environment responds to this action.   At last, the
agent takes the next action based on the response.   This process iterates until the task is finished.   The
complete agent-environment interaction process is called a  trial , and each interaction turn is called a

the cross-trial information can be incorporated into the memory module.
step .   For each trial, the agent can take multiple steps to form a potential solution to the task.   For each
task, the agent can explore multiple trials to accomplish the task [ 5 ].   Formally, at step  t , we use  a t
and  o t   to represent the agent action and the observed environment response, respectively.   Then, a
T -length trial can be represented as  ξ T   =  { a 1 , o 1 , a 2 , o 2 , ..., o T  , a T  } .
In the above definitions, task and environment are the most coarse-grained concepts, while step is the
most fine-grained one.   They together describe the complete agent-environment interaction process.
A Toy Example .   Based on the above definitions, we show a toy example and use it throughout the
paper to provide more intuitions.   In this example, the agent has two tasks:   (A)  Making a trip plan
for Alice in Beijing from 5/1/2024 to 5/3/2024 , where the agent has to (i) buy a round-trip flight
ticket, (ii) determine several attractions according to Alice’s preferences, and (iii) arrange the visiting
order of these attractions.   (B)  Recommending a movie for Alice on 5/10/2024 , where the agent
has to (i) determine the time that Alice is free to watch movies, and (ii) select a movie according
to   Alice’s   watching   preference.   For   each   task,   we   present   a   potential   trial   in   the   following   (also
illustrated in  Figure 3 (a)).   For task (A), the trial is:
[Step   1]   Agent :   I   need   to   book   flight   tickets   from   Shanghai   to   Beijing   on   5/1/2024,   and   from
Beijing   to   Shanghai   on   5/3/2024   through   the   online   ticket   office.   Environment   (Online   Ticket
Office) :   The order has been confirmed.   The departure flight takes off at 9:00 AM, and your ticket
number is EK240501SX9021.   The returning flight takes off at 4:30 PM, and your ticket number is
LG240503FN6317.   Please arrive at the airport on time for your flight.
[Step 2]  Agent :   I have acquired external knowledge from the magazine  Attractions in Beijing .   It
shows that  the Great Wall, the Forbidden City  and  the Summer Palace  are famous.   According to
Alice’s preferences, I think she prefers ancient architecture, so I determine  the Forbidden City  and
the Summer Palace  as the destinations.   Environment (Alice) :   Well done!
[Step 3]  Agent :   Now, I need to arrange the visiting order for Alice.   According to the information
above, I recommend visiting  the Summer Palace  after she arrives in Beijing because it is suitable to
spend a whole afternoon there and watch the sunset.   Then, she can go to  the Forbidden City  the next
day, which would give her plenty of time.   Finally, she can return to Shanghai on the third day and
take a rest.   Environment (Alice) :   I love this plan.   Thanks!

For task (B), the trial is:
[Step 1]  Agent :   According to my previous experiences of movie recommendations for Alice, she
prefers to start watching movies at 9:00 PM, because she has finished work by then.   I should ask
Alice if she is available at that time.   Environment (Alice) :   Of course, it is a nice time!
[Step 2]  Agent :   Now, I need to find some movies that Alice has marked "want to watch" on Netflix.
Environment (Netflix) :   Alice’s want to watch:   Interstellar ,  Planet Terror  and  Candle in the Tomb .
[Step 3]  Agent : Since Alice never watches horror movies at night,  Interstellar  would be more suitable
for her.   Now, I need to confirm with Alice about the movie.   Environment (Alice) :   Great!   I like it!
3.2
Narrow Definition of the Agent Memory
In   a   narrow   sense,   the   memory   of   the   agent   is   only   relevant   to   the   historical   information   within
the   same   trial.   Formally,   for   a   given   task,   the   historical   information   of   the   trial   before   step   t   is
ξ t   =   { a 1 , o 1 , a 2 , o 2 , ..., a t − 1 , o t − 1 } , and then the memory is derived based on  ξ t .   In the above toy
example, for task (A), the agent at [step 3] needs to arrange the visiting order for Alice; at this time,
its memory contains the information about the selected attractions and arrival time in [step 1] and
[step 2].   For task (B), the agent has to choose a movie for Alice at [step 3]; at this time, its memory
contains the arranged time to watch films.
3.3
Broad Definition of the Agent Memory
In   a   broad   sense,   the   memory   of   the   agent   can   come   from   much   wider   sources,   for   example,
the information across different trials and the external knowledge beyond the agent-environment
interactions.   Formally, given a series of sequential tasks  {T 1 ,   T 2 , ...,   T K } , for task  T k , the memory
information   at   step   t   comes   from   three   sources:   (1)   the   historical   information   within   the   same
trial,   that   is,   ξ k
t   =   { a k
1 , o k
1 , ..., a k
t − 1 , o k
t − 1 } ,   where   we   add   superscript   k   to   label   the   task   index.
(2)   The   historical   information   across   different   trials,   that   is,   Ξ k   =   { ξ 1 , ξ 2 , ..., ξ k − 1 , ξ k ′ } ,   where
ξ j   ( j   ∈{ 1 , ..., k  − 1 } )  represents the trials of task  j 1 , and  ξ k ′   denotes the previously explored trials
for task  T k .   (3) External knowledge, which is represented by  D k
t   .   The memory of the agent is derived
based   on   ( ξ k
t   ,   Ξ k ,   D k
t   ) .   In   the   above   toy   example,   for   task   (A),   if   there   are   several   failed   trials,
that is, the feedback from Alice is negative, then these trials can be incorporated into the agent’s
memory to avoid future similar errors (corresponding to  ξ k ′ ).   In addition, for task (B), the agent
may recommend movies relevant to the attractions that Alice has visited in task (A) to capture her
recent preferences (corresponding to  { ξ 1 , ξ 2 , ..., ξ k − 1 } ).   In the agent decision process, it has also
referred to the magazine  Attractions in Beijing  for making trip plans, which is the external knowledge
(corresponding to  D k
t   ) for the current task  T k .
3.4
Memory-assisted Agent-Environment Interaction
As mentioned at the beginning of  Section 3 , there are three key phases in the agent-environment
interaction process.   The agent memory module implements these phases through three operations
including memory writing, memory management, and memory reading.
Memory   Writing .   This   operation   aims   to   project   the   raw   observations   into   the   actually   stored
memory contents, which are more informative [ 7 ] and concise [ 6 ].   It corresponds to the first phase of
the agent-environment interaction process.   Given a task  T k , if the agent takes an action  a k
t   at step  t ,
and the environment provides an observation  o k
t   , then the memory writing operation can be formally
represented as:
m k
t   =  W ( { a k
t   , o k
t   } ) ,
where  W   is a projecting function.   m k
t   is the finally stored memory contents, which can be either
natural languages or parametric representations.   In the above toy example, for task (A), the agent is
supposed to remember the flight arrangement and the decision of attractions after [step 2].   For task
(B), the agent should memorize the fact that Alice hopes to watch movies at 9:00 PM, after [step 1].
Memory Management .   This operation aims to process the stored memory information to make
it more effective, for example, summarizing high-level concepts to make the agent more general-
1 For each task, there can be multiple trials for exploring the final solution, and all of them can be incorporated
into the memory.

izable   [ 6 ],   merging   similar   information   to   reduce   redundancy   [ 7 ],   and   forgetting   unimportant   or
irrelevant information to remove its negative influence.   This operation corresponds to the second
phase of the agent-environment interaction process.   Let  M   k
t − 1   be the memory contents for task  k
before step  t , and suppose  m k
t   is the stored information at step  t  based on the above memory writing
operation, then, the memory management operation can be represented by:
M   k
t   =  P ( M  k
t − 1 , m k
t   ) ,
where   P   is   a   function   that   iteratively   processes   the   stored   memory   information.   For   the   narrow
memory definition, the iteration only happens within the same trial, and the memory is emptied when
the trial is ended.   For the broad memory definition, the iteration happens across different trials or
even tasks, as well as the integrations of external knowledge.   For task (B) in the above toy example,
the agent can conclude that Alice enjoys watching science fiction movies in the evening, which can
be used as a default rule to make recommendations for Alice in the future.
Memory Reading .   This operation aims to obtain important information from the memory to support
the next agent action.   It corresponds to the third phase of the agent-environment interaction process.
Suppose  M   k
t   is the memory contents for task  k  at step  t ,  c k
t   is the context of the next action, then the
memory reading operation can be represented by:
ˆ
M   k
t   =  R ( M  k
t   , c k
t +1 ) ,
where  R  is usually implemented by computing the similarity between  M   k
t   and  c k
t +1   [ 82 ].   ˆ
M   k
t   is used
as parts of the final prompt to drive the agent’s next action.   For task (B) in the above toy example,
when the agent decides on the final recommended movie in [Step 3], it should focus on the “want to
watch” list in [Step 2] and select one from it.
Based   on   the   above   operations,   we   can   derive   a   unified   function   for   the   evolving   process   from
{ a k
t   , o k
t   }  to  a k
t +1 , that is:
a k
t +1   =  LLM { R ( P ( M  k
t − 1 , W ( { a k
t   , o k
t   } )) , c k
t +1 ) } ,
where  LLM  is the large language model.   The complete agent-environment interaction process can be
easily obtained by iteratively expanding this function (see  Figure 3 (b) for an intuitive illustration).
Remark.   This function provides a general formulation of the agent memorizing process.   Previous
works may use different specifications.   For example, in [ 5 ],  R  and  P   are set as identical functions,
and  P   only takes effect at the end of a trial.   In Park et al.  [83] ,  R  is implemented based on three
criteria including similarity, time interval, and importance, and  P   is realized by a reflection process
to obtain more abstract thoughts.   In this section, we focus on the overall framework of the agent’s
memory operations.   More detailed realizations of  W ,  P , and  R  are deferred in  Section 5 .

Why We Need the Memory in LLM-based Agent
Above,   we   have   introduced   what   is   the   memory   of   LLM-based   agents.   Before   comprehensively
presenting how to implement it, in this section, we briefly show why memory is necessary for building
LLM-based agents, where we expand our discussion from three perspectives including cognitive
psychology, self-evolution, and agent applications.
4.1
Perspective of Cognitive Psychology
Cognitive psychology is the scientific study of human mental processes such as attention, language
use,   memory,   perception,   problem-solving,   creativity,   and   reasoning 2 .   Among   these   processes,
memory is widely recognized as an extremely important one [ 84 ].   It is fundamental for humans to
learn knowledge by accumulating important information and abstracting high-level concepts [ 85 ],
form social norms by remembering cultural values and individual experiences [ 86 ], take reasonable
behaviors by imagining the potential positive and negative consequences [87], and among others.
A major goal of LLM-based agents is to replace humans for accomplishing different tasks.   To make
agents behave like humans, following human’s working mechanisms to design the agents is a natural
and essential choice [ 88 ].   Since memory is important for humans, designing memory modules is also
significant for the agents.   In addition, cognitive psychology has been studied for a long time, so many
effective human memory theories and architectures have been accumulated, which can support more
advanced capabilities of the agents [89].

4.2
Perspective of Self-Evolution
To accomplish different practical tasks, agents have to self-evolve in dynamic environments [ 90 ].
In   the   agent-environment   interaction   process,   the   memory   is   key   to   the   following   aspects:   (1)
Experience accumulation . An important function of the memory is to remember past error plannings,
inappropriate behaviors, or failed experiences, so as to make the agent more effective for handling
similar tasks in the future [ 91 ].   This is extremely important for enhancing the learning efficiency of
the agent in the self-evolving process.   (2)  Environment exploration .   To autonomously evolve in
the environment, the agents have to explore different actions and learn from the feedback [ 92 ].   By
remembering historical information, the memory can help to better decide when and how to make
explorations, for example, focusing more on previously failed trials or actions with lower exploring
frequencies   [ 93 ].   (3)   Knowledge   abstraction .   Another   important   function   of   the   memory   is   to
summarize and abstract high-level information from raw observations, which is the basis for the agent
to be more adaptive and generalizable to unseen environments [ 82 ].   In summary, self-evolution is the
basic characteristic of LLM-based agents, and memory is of key importance to self-evolution.
4.3
Perspective of Agent Applications
In many applications, memory is an indispensable component of the agent.   For example, in a conver-
sational agent, the memory stores information about historical conversations, which is necessary for
the agent to generate the next response.   Without memory, the agent does not know the context, and
cannot continue the conversation [ 94 ].   In a simulation agent, memory is of great importance to make
the agent consistently follow the role profiles.   Without memory, the agent may easily step out of the
role during the simulation process [ 95 ].   Both of the above examples show that the memory is not an
optional component, but is necessary for the agents to accomplish given tasks.
In the above three perspectives, the first one reveals that the memory builds the cognitive basis of
the agent.   The second and third ones show that the memory is necessary for the agent’s evolving
principles and applications, which provide insights for designing agents with memory mechanisms.

How to Implement the Memory of LLM-based Agent
In this section, we discuss the implementation of the memory module from three perspectives: memory
sources, memory forms, and memory operations. Memory sources refer to where the memory contents
come from.   Memory forms focus on how to represent the memory contents.   Memory operations
aim to process the memory contents.   These three perspectives provide a comprehensive review of
memory implementation methods, which is helpful for future research.   For better demonstration, we
present an overview of implementation methods in  Figure 4 .
5.1
Memory Sources
In previous works, the memory contents may come from different sources.   Based on our formulation
in  Section 3 , these sources can be classified into three categories, that is, the information inside a trial,
the information across different trials, and the external knowledge.   The former two are dynamically

generated in the agent-environment interaction process ( e.g. , task internal information), while the
latter is static information outside the loop ( e.g. , task external information).   We summarize previous
works on memory sources in  Table 1 .
5.1.1
Inside-trial Information
In the agent-environment interaction process, the historical steps within a trial are usually the most
relevant and informative signals to support the agent’s future actions.   Almost all the previous works
use this information as a part of the memory sources.
Representative   Studies .   Generative   Agents   [ 83 ]   aims   to   simulate   human’s   daily   behaviors   by
using   LLM-based   agents.   The   memory   of   an   agent   is   derived   from   the   historical   behaviors   to
achieve a target, for example, the collection of relevant papers when researching on a specific topic.
MemoChat   [ 94 ]   aims   to   chat   with   humans,   where   the   memory   of   the   agent   is   derived   based   on
the   conversation   history   of   a   dialogue   session.   TiM   [ 97 ]   aims   to   enhance   the   agent’s   reasoning
capability   by   self-generating   multiple   thoughts   after   accomplishing   a   task,   which   is   used   as   the
memory to provide more generalizable information.   Voyager [ 99 ] focuses on building game agents
based on Minecraft, where the memory contains executable codes of preliminary and basic actions
to accomplish a task.   It should be noted that the inside-trial information not only includes agent-
environment interactions, but also contains interaction contexts, such as time and location information.

Discussion .   The   inside-trial   information   is   the   most   obvious   and   intuitive   source   that   should   be
leveraged to construct the agent’s memory since it is highly relevant to the current task that the agent
has to accomplish.   However, relying solely on inside-trial information may prevent the agent from
accumulating valuable knowledge from various tasks and learning more generalizable information.
Thus, many studies also explore how to effectively utilize the information across different tasks to
build the memory module, which is detailed in the following sections.
5.1.2
Cross-trial Information
For LLM-based agents, the information accumulated across multiple trials in the environment is also
a crucial part of the memory, typically including successful and failed actions and their insights, such
as failure reasons, common action patterns to succeed, and so on.
Representative Studies .   One of the most prominent studies is Reflexion [ 5 ], which proposes verbal
reinforcement learning for LLM-based agents.   It derives the experiences from past trials in verbal
form, and applies them in subsequent trials to improve the performance of the same task.   Furthermore,
Retroformer [ 103 ] fine-tunes the reflection model, enabling the agent to extract cross-trial information
from past trials more effectively.   In Synapse [ 91 ], the agents focus on solving the computer control
tasks.   Their memory can record cross-trial information through successful exemplars, which would
be used as references on similar trials.   In ExpeL [ 82 ], the agents are required to solve a collection of
complex interactive tasks within the environment.   They store and organize completed trajectories,
and recall similar ones for the new task.   In the recalled trajectories, successful cases will be compared
with failed ones to identify the patterns to succeed.
Discussion .   According to the accumulated memory of cross-trial information, the agents are able to
accumulate experiences, which is important for their evolution.   Based on the past experiences, the
agents can adjust their actions based on the overall feedback of the whole process.   In contrast to the
inside-trial observations, which serve as short-term memory, the trial experiences can be considered
as long-term memory.   It utilizes feedback from different trials to support a wider range of agent
trials,   providing   more   prolonged   experiential   support   for   agents.   However,   the   limitation   lies   in
the fact that both inside-trial and cross-trial information require the agents to personally engage in
agent-environment interactions, where external experiences and knowledge are not included.
5.1.3
External Knowledge
An important characteristic of LLM-based agents is that they can be directly communicated and con-
trolled in natural languages.   As such, LLM-based agents can easily incorporate external knowledge
in textual forms ( e.g. , Wikipedia   3 ) to facilitate their decisions.
Representative Studies .   In ReAct [ 104 ], the agents are required to answer questions about general
knowledge by multiple reasoning steps. They can utilize Wikipedia APIs to obtain external knowledge
if   they   lack   information   during   these   steps.   GITM   [ 93 ]   intends   to   design   agents   in   Minecraft,
which can explore in complex and sparse-reward environments.   The agents draw from the online
Minecraft   Wiki   and   craft   recipes   to   provide   an   infinite   source   of   knowledge   for   their   navigation.
CodeAgent [ 114 ] focuses on the repo-level code generation task, which commonly requires complex
dependencies and extensive documentation.   It designs a web search strategy for acquiring related
external knowledge.   ChatDoctor [ 115 ] adapts LLM-based agents to the medical domain.   It fine-tunes
an acquisition process to retrieve external knowledge from Wikipedia and medical databases.
Discussion .   The external knowledge can be obtained from both private and public sources.   It provides
LLM-based agents with much knowledge beyond their internal environment, which might be difficult
or   even   impossible   for   the   agent   to   acquire   by   agent-environment   interactions.   Moreover,   most
external knowledge can be acquired by accessing the APIs of various tools dynamically in real time
according to the task needs, thus mitigating the problem of outdated knowledge.   Integrating external
knowledge into the memory of LLM-based agents significantly expands their knowledge boundaries,
providing them with unlimited, up-to-date, and well-founded knowledge for decision-making.
5.2
Memory Forms
In general, there are two forms to represent the memory contents:   textual form and parametric form.
In textual form, the information is explicitly retained and recalled by natural languages.   In parametric

form,   the   memory   information   is   encoded   into   parameters   and   implicitly   influences   the   agent’s
actions.   We summarize previous works on memory forms with their implementations in  Table 2 .
5.2.1
Memory in Textual Form
Textual form is currently the mainstream method to represent the memory contents, which is featured
in   better   interpretability,   easier   implementation,   and   faster   read-write   efficiency.   In   specific,   the
textual form can be both non-structured representations like raw natural languages and structured
information such as tuples, databases, and so on.   In general, previous studies use the textual form
memory to store four types of information including (1) complete agent-environment interactions, (2)
recent agent-environment interactions, (3) retrieved agent-environment interactions, and (4) external
knowledge.   In the former three methods, the memory leverages natural languages to describe the
information within the agent-environment interaction loop.   In the former three types, they record
the information inside the agent-environment interaction loop, while the last type leverages natural
languages to store information outside that loop.
Complete Interactions .   This method stores all the information of the agent-environment interaction
history based on long-context strategies [ 116 ].   For the example in  Section 3.1 , the memory of the
14

---


<!-- Page 15 -->

agent in task (A) after step 2 can be implemented by concatenating all the information before step 2,
and the final textual form memory is:   "Your memory is [Step 1] (Agent) ...   (Online Ticket Office) ...
[Step 2] ...   Please infer based on your memory".
In the previous work, different models store the memory information using different strategies.   For
example, in LongChat [ 116 ], the agents focus on understanding natural languages in long-context
scenarios.   It fine-tunes the foundation model for better adapting to memorize complete interactions.
Memory Sandbox [ 117 ] intends to alleviate the impact of irrelevant memory in conversations.   It
designs   a   transparent   and   interactive   method   to   manage   the   memory   of   agents,   which   removes
irrelevant memory before concatenating them as a prompt.   Moreover, some efforts are dedicated to
enhancing the capacity of LLMs to handle longer contexts [118, 119].
While storing all the agent-environment interactions can maintain comprehensive information, obvious
limitations exist in terms of computational cost, inference time, and inference robustness.   Firstly,
the fast-growing long-context memory in practice results in high computational cost during LLM
inference, due to the quadratic growth of the time complexity of attention computation with sequence
length.   It thus requires much more computing resources and significantly increases inference latency,
which hinders its practical deployment.   What’s more, with its fast growth, the memory length can
easily   exceed   the   upper   bound   of   the   sequence   length   during   LLM’s   pretraining,   which   makes   a
truncation of memory necessary.   Thus, it can lead to information loss due to the incompleteness
of   agent   memory.   Last   but   not   least,   it   can   lead   to   biases   and   unrobustness   in   LLM’s   inference.
Specifically,   a   previous   research   [ 120 ]   has   shown   that,   the   positions   of   text   segments   in   a   long
context   can   greatly   affect   their   utilization,   so   the   memory   in   the   long-context   prompt   can   not   be
treated equally and stably.   All these drawbacks show the need to design extra memory modules for
LLM-based agents, rather than straightforwardly concatenating all the information into a prompt.
Recent Interactions .   This method stores and maintains the most recently acquired memories using
natural languages, thereby enhancing the efficiency of memory information utilization according
to the Principle of Locality [ 121 ].   In task (B) of the example in  Section 3.1 , we can just remember
Alice’s preferences in the recent three years, and truncate the distant part, where the recent three
years can be considered as the memory window size.
In   previous   studies,   there   are   various   strategies   to   store   recent   textual   memories.   For   example,
SCM [ 98 ] proposes a flash memory based on the cache mechanism, which preserves observations from
the recent  t  − 1  time steps, aimed at enhancing the recency of information.   MemGPT [ 100 ] considers
the agent as an operating system, which can dynamically interact with users through a natural interface.
It designs the working context to hold recent histories, as a part of virtual context management.   In
RecAgent   [ 95 ],   the   agents   are   designed   to   simulate   user   behaviors   in   movie   recommendations.
It   stores   some   temporal   information   in   short-term   memory   as   an   intermediate   cache,   which   can
simulate the memory mechanism of the human brain [ 122 ,  123 ].   These representative methods can
dynamically   update   memories   based   on   recent   interactions,   and   pay   more   attention   to   the   recent
context that is important for the current stage.
Caching the memory according to recency is an effective way to enhance memory efficiency, and it
enables agents to focus more on the recent information.   However, in long-term tasks, this method
fails to access key information from distant memories.   It can result in the loss of potentially crucial
information that is not within the immediate cache window.   In other words, emphasizing on recency
can inherently neglect earlier, yet critical information, thus posing challenges in scenarios requiring a
comprehensive understanding of past events.
Retrieved Interactions .   Unlike the above method which truncates memories based on time, this
method typically selects memory contents based on their relevance, importance, and topics.   It ensures
the inclusion of distant but crucial memories in the decision-making process, thereby addressing the
limitation of only memorizing recent information.   In task (A) of the example in  Section 3.1 , Alice’s
preferences have been stored in the memory before this task.   At [Step 2],   the agent will retrieve
the most relevant aspects of Alice’s preferences from memory based on the query keyword "travel",
obtaining Alice’s scenic spot preference for ancient architectures.   In general, retrieval methods will
generate embeddings as indexes for memory entries during memory writing, along with recording
auxiliary information to assist in retrieval.   During memory reading, matching scores are calculated
for each memory entry, and the top- K   entries will be used for the decision-making process of agents.
15

<!-- Page 16 -->

In existing studies, most agents utilize retrieval methods to process the memory information.   For
example, Park et al.  [83]  first calculate the relevance between the current context and memory entries
by   cosine   similarity,   and   obtain   the   importance   and   recency   according   to   auxiliary   information.
MemoryBank [ 6 ] employs a dual-tower dense retrieval model to find related information from past
conversations.   Each   memory   entry   is   encoded   into   an   embedding   and   subsequently   indexed   by
FAISS [ 124 ] to improve the efficiency of retrieval.   When reading memories, the current context will
be encoded as representations to obtain the most relevant memory.   Moreover, RET-LLM [ 7 ] intends
to   design   a   write-read   memory   module   for   general   usage.   It   utilizes   Locality-Sensitive   Hashing
(LSH) to retrieve tuples with relative entries in the database to provide more information.   In addition,
ChatDB [ 96 ] designs to utilize symbolic memory, and proposes to generate SQL statements to retrieve
from database to obtain stored information.
The retrieval methods considerably depend on the accuracy and efficiency of obtaining expected
information.   An inaccurate retrieval strategy can potentially acquire unrelated information that is
unhelpful for agent inference.   And a heavy retrieval system can lead to large computational costs
and long time latency, especially when handling massive information.   Moreover, retrieval methods
typically store homogeneous information inside the environment, where all the information is in a
consistent form.   For heterogeneous information outside the environment,   it’s difficult to directly
apply the same method for memory storage.
External   Knowledge .   To   obtain   more   information,   some   agents   acquire   external   knowledge   by
invoking tools, with the aim of transforming additional relevant knowledge into their own memories
for decision-making.   For instance, accessing external knowledge through Application Programming
Interface (API) is a common practice [ 104 ,   5 ].   Nowadays,   abundant public information,   such as
Wikipedia and OpenWeatherMap 4 , are available online (either free of charge or on a paying basis),
and   can   be   conveniently   accessed   through   API   calls.   For   instance,   in   [Step   2]   of   task   (A)   of   the
example in  Section 3.1 , external knowledge from the digital magazine is obtained with tool methods.
In existing models, Toolformer [ 125 ] proposes to teach LLM to use tools, which can acquire external
knowledge for better solving tasks.   Furthermore, ToolLLM [ 126 ] empowers Llama [ 127 ] with the
ability to utilize more APIs in RapidAPI 5   and to enable multi-tool usage, which provides a general
interface to extend agents’ ability.   In TPTU [ 110 ], the agents are incorporated in both task planning
and tool usage, in order to tackle intricate problems.   The follow-up work [ 111 ] further improves
its ability extensively like retrieval.   In ToRA [ 128 ], the agents are required to solve mathematical
problems.   They utilize imitation learning to improve their ability to use program-based tools.
The   above   methods   significantly   advance   the   capabilities   of   agents   by   allowing   them   to   access
external   up-to-date   and   real-world   information   from   diverse   sources.   However,   the   reliability   of
this information can be questionable due to potential inaccuracies and biases [ 18 ].   Furthermore, the
integration of tools into agents demands a comprehensive understanding to interpret the retrieved
information across various contexts, which can incur higher computational costs and complications
in aligning external data with internal decision-making processes.   Additionally, utilizing external
APIs   brings   forth   concerns   regarding   privacy,   data   security,   and   compliance   with   usage   policies,
necessitating rigorous management and oversight [18].
5.2.2
Memory in Parametric Form
An alternative type of approaches is to represent memory in parametric form.   They do not take up
the extra length of context in prompts, so they are not constrained by the length limitations of LLM
context.   However, the parametric memory form is still under-researched, and we categorize previous
works into two types:   fine-tuning methods and memory editing methods.
Fine-tuning   Methods.   Integrating   external   knowledge   into   the   memory   of   agents   is   beneficial
for enriching domain-specific knowledge on top of its general knowledge.   To infuse the domain
knowledge into LLMs, supervised fine-tuning is a common approach, which empowers agents with
the memory of domain experts.   It significantly improves the agent’s ability to accomplish domain-
specific tasks.   In task (A) of the example in  Section 3.1 , the external knowledge of attractions from
magazines can be fine-tuned into the parameters of LLMs prior to this task.

<!-- Page 17 -->

In previous works, Character-LLM [ 105 ] focuses on the role-play circumstance.   It utilizes supervised
fine-tuning strategies with role-related data ( e.g.,  experiences), to endow agents with the specific
traits   and   characteristics   of   the   role.   Huatuo   [ 107 ]   intends   to   empower   agents   with   professional
ability in the biomedical domain.   It tries to fine-tune Llama [ 127 ] on Chinese medical knowledge
bases.   Besides, in order to create artificial doctors, DoctorGLM [ 129 ] fine-tunes ChatGLM [ 130 ]
with LoRA [ 131 ],   and Radiology-GPT [ 132 ] improves domain knowledge on radiology analysis
by supervised fine-tuning on an annotated radiology dataset.   Moreover,   InvestLM [ 113 ] collects
investment data and fine-tunes it to improve domain-specific abilities on financial investment.
The   fine-tuning   methods   can   effectively   bridge   the   gap   between   general   agents   and   specialized
agents.   It improves the capability of agents on the tasks that require high accuracy and reliability on
domain-specific information.   Nevertheless, fine-tuning LLMs for specific domains could potentially
lead to overfitting, and it also raises concerns about catastrophic forgetting, where LLMs may forget
the original knowledge because of updating their parameters.   Another limitation of fine-tuning lies
in the computational cost and time consumption, as well as the requirement of a large amount of
data.   Therefore, most fine-tuning approaches are applied to offline scenarios, and can seldom deal
with   online   scenarios,   such   as   fine-tuning   with   agent   observations   and   trial   experiences.   Due   to
the frequent agent-environment interactions, it is unaffordable for the cost of backpropagation to
fine-tune every step of the online and dynamic interactions.
Memory Editing Methods.   Apart from the fine-tuning approaches, another type of methods for
infusing memory into model parameters is knowledge editing [ 133 ,  134 ].   Unlike fine-tuning methods
that extract patterns from certain datasets, knowledge editing methods specifically target and adjust
only   the   facts   that   need   to   be   changed.   It   ensures   that   unrelated   knowledge   remains   unaffected.
Knowledge editing methods are more suitable for small-scale memory adjustments.   Generally, they
have lower computational costs, making them more suitable for online scenarios.   In our example of
task (B), Alice always watches movies at 9:00 PM from the agent’s memory, but she may recently
change her work and would not be empty at 9:00 PM. If so, the related memory (such as routines at
9:00 PM) should be edited, which can be implemented by knowledge editing methods.
In   previous   studies,   MAC   [ 106 ]   intends   to   design   an   effective   and   efficient   memory   adaptation
framework for online scenarios.   It utilizes meta-learning to substitute the optimization step.   Per-
sonalityEdit [ 135 ] focuses on editing the personality of LLMs and agents, where it changes their
traits based on theories such as the big-five factor.   MEND [ 134 ] utilizes the idea of meta-learning
to train a lightweight model, which is capable of generating modifications for model parameters of
a pre-trained language model.   APP [ 136 ] studies whether adding a new fact leads to catastrophic
forgetting of existing facts.   It focuses on the impact of neighbor perturbation on memory addition.
Moreover, KnowledgeEditor [ 133 ] trains a hyper-network to predict the modification of model pa-
rameters when injecting memory based on a learning-to-update problem formulation.   Wang et al.
[137]  propose a new optimization target to change the poisoning knowledge of LLM, and maintain
the general performance at the same time.   For LLM-based agents, the agents can change bad memory
by knowledge editing, which can be considered as a type of forgetting mechanism.
Knowledge editing methods provide an innovative way to update the information stored within the
parameters of LLMs.   By specifically targeting and adjusting the facts, these methods can ensure
the   non-targeted   knowledge   unaffected   during   updates,   thus   mitigating   the   issue   of   catastrophic
forgetting.   Moreover, the targeted adjustment mechanism allows for more efficient and less resource-
intensive updates, making knowledge editing an appealing choice for high-precision and real-time
modifications.   However, despite these promising developments, computational costs of meta-training
and the preservation of unrelated memories remain significant challenges.
5.2.3
Advantages and Disadvantages of Textual and Parametric Memory
Textual memory and parametric memory have their strengths and weaknesses respectively, making
them suitable for different memory contents and application scenarios.   In this section, we discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of these two forms of memory from various aspects.
Effectiveness.   The textual memory stores raw information about the agent-environment interactions,
which   is   more   comprehensive   and   detailed.   However,   it   is   constrained   by   the   token   limitation
of   LLM   prompts,   which   makes   the   agent   hard   to   store   extensive   information.   In   contrast,   the
parametric memory is not limited by the prompt length, but it may suffer from information loss when
transforming texts into parameters, and the complex memory training can bring additional challenges.
17

<!-- Page 18 -->

Efficiency.   For textual memory, each LLM inference requires to integrate memory into the context
prompt, which leads to higher costs and longer processing times.   In contrast, for parametric memory,
the information can be integrated into the parameters of the LLM, eliminating the extra costs of these
contexts.   However,   parametric   memory   takes   additional   costs   in   the   writing   process,   but   textual
memory is easier to write, especially for small amounts of data.   In a nutshell, textual memory is more
efficient in writing, while parametric memory is more efficient in reading.
Interpretability.   Textual memory is usually more explainable than the parametric one, since natural
languages   are   the   most   natural   and   straightforward   strategies   for   humans   to   understand,   while
parametric memory is commonly represented in latent space.   Nevertheless, such explainability is
obtained at the cost of information density.   This is because the sequences of words in textual memory
are represented in a discrete space, which is not as dense as continuous space in parametric memory.
In conclusion, the trade-offs between these two types of memories make them suitable for different
applications.   For example, for the tasks that require recalling recent interactions, like conversational
and context-specific tasks, textual memory seems more effective.   For the tasks that require a large
amount of memory, or well-established knowledge, parametric memory can be a better choice.
5.3
Memory Operations
We separate the entire procedure of memory into three operations:   memory writing, memory manage-
ment, and memory reading.   These three typically collaborate to achieve memory function, providing
information for LLM inference.   We summarize previous works on memory operations in  Table 3 .
5.3.1
Memory Writing
After the information is perceived by the agent, a part of it will be stored by the agent for further usage
through the memory writing operation, and it is crucial to recognize which information is essential to
store.   Many studies choose to store the raw information, while others also put the summary of the
raw information into the memory module.
Representative Studies.   In TiM [ 97 ], the raw information will be extracted as the relation between
two entities, and stored in a structured database.   When writing into the database, similar contents will
be stored in the same group.   In SCM [ 98 ], it designs a memory controller to decide when to execute
the operations.   The controller serves as a guide for the whole memory module.   In MemGPT [ 100 ],
the memory writing is entirely self-directed.   The agents can autonomously update the memory based
on the contexts.   In MemoChat [ 94 ], the agents summarize each conversation segment by abstracting
the mainly discussed topics and storing them as keys for indexing memory pieces.
Discussion.   Previous research indicates that designing the strategy of information extraction during
the memory writing operation is vital [ 94 ].   This is because the original information is commonly
lengthy and noisy.   Besides, different environments may provide various forms of feedback, and how
to extract and represent the information as memory is also significant for memory writing.
5.3.2
Memory Management
For human beings, memory information is constantly processed and abstracted in the brains.   The
memory in the agent can also be managed by reflecting to generate higher-level memories, merging
redundant memory entries, and forgetting unimportant, early memories.
Representative Studies.   In MemoryBank [ 6 ], the agents process and distill the conversations into a
high-level summary of daily events, similar to how humans recall key aspects of their experiences.
Through long-term interactions, they continually evaluate and refine their knowledge, generating daily
insights into personality traits.   In Voyager [ 99 ], the agents are able to refine their memory based on
the feedback of the environment.   In Generative Agents [ 83 ], the agents can reflect to get higher-level
information, where the abstract thoughts are generated from agents.   The reflection process will be
activated when there are accumulated events that are enough to address.   For GITM [ 93 ], in order to
establish common reference plans for various situations, key actions from multiple plans are further
summarized in the memory module.
Discussion.   Most of the memory management operations are inspired by the working mechanism of
human brains.   With the strong capability of LLMs to simulate human minds, these operations can
help the agents to better generate high-level information and interact with environments.

Memory Reading
When   the   agents   require   information   for   reasoning   and   decision-making,   the   memory   reading
operation   will   extract   related   information   from   memory   for   usage.   Therefore,   how   to   access   the
related information for the current state is important.   Due to the massive quantity of memory entities,
and the fact that not all of them are pertinent to the current state, careful design is required to extract
useful information based on relevance and other task-orientated factors.
Representative Studies.   In ChatDB [ 96 ], the memory reading operation is executed by the SQL
statements.   These statements will be generated by agents as a series of Chain-of-Memory in advance.
In MPC [ 101 ], the agents can retrieve relevant memory from the memory pool.   This method also
proposes to provide Chain-of-Thought examples for ignoring certain memory.   ExpeL [ 82 ] utilizes
the Faiss [ 124 ] vector store as the pool of memory, and obtains the top- K   successful trajectories that
share the highest similarity scores with the current task.
Discussion.   To some extent, the memory reading and writing operations are collaborative, and the
forms of memory writing greatly influence the methods of memory reading.   For the forms of textual

memory,   most previous works use the text similarity and other auxiliary information for reading.
For the forms of parametric memory, existing models may just utilize the updated parameters for
inference, which can be seen as an implicit reading process.

How to Evaluate the Memory in LLM-based Agent
How to effectively evaluate the memory module remains an open problem, where diverse evaluation
strategies   have   been   proposed   in   previous   works   according   to   different   applications.   To   clearly
show the common ideas of different evaluation methods, in this section, we summarize a general
framework,   which   includes   two   broad   evaluation   strategies   (see   Figure   5   for   an   overview),   that
is, (1) direct evaluation, which independently measures the capability of the memory module.   (2)
indirect evaluation, which evaluates the memory module via end-to-end agent tasks.   If the tasks can
be effectively accomplished, the memory module is demonstrated to be useful.
6.1
Direct Evaluation
This type of approaches regards the memory of the agents as a stand-alone component and evaluates
its   effectiveness   independently.   Previous   studies   can   be   categorized   into   two   classes:   subjective
evaluation and objective evaluation.   The subjective evaluation aims to measure memory effectiveness
based on human judgments, which can be widely used in the scenarios that lack objective ground
truths.   Objective evaluation assesses memory effectiveness based on numerical metrics, which makes
it easy to compare different memory modules.
6.1.1
Subjective Evaluation
In subjective evaluation, there are two key problems, that is, (1) what aspects should be evaluated
and (2) how to conduct the evaluation process.   To begin with, the following two aspects are the most
common perspectives leveraged to evaluate the memory module.
Coherence.   This aspect refers to whether the recalled memory is natural and suitable for the current
context.   For example, if the agent is making a plan for Alice’s travel, the memory should be related
to her preference for traveling rather than working.   In previous works, Modarressi et al.  [7]  study
whether the memory module could provide proper references among the ever-changing knowledge.
Liang et al.  [98]  present some examples to demonstrate the relation between the current query and
historical memory.   Zhong et al.  [6]  and Liu et al.  [97]  assess the coherence of responses that integrate
context and retrieved memory by scoring labels.   Lee et al.  [101]  focus on the contradiction between
the recalled memory and contexts.
Rationality.   This aspect aims to evaluate whether the recalled memory is reasonable.   For example, if
the agent is asked to answer "Where is the Summer Palace", the recalled memory should be "The
Summer Palace is in Beijing" rather than "The Summer Palace is on the Moon".   In previous works,
Lee et al.  [101]  ask crowd workers to directly score the rationality of the retrieved memory.   Zhong
et al.  [6]  and Liu et al.  [97]  recruit human evaluators to check if the memory contains reasonable
answers for the current question.
As for how to conduct the evaluation process, there are two important problems.   The first one is how
to select the human evaluators.   In general, the evaluators should be familiar with the evaluation task,
which ensures that the labeling results are convincing and reliable.   In addition, the backgrounds of
the evaluators should be diverse to remove subjective biases of specific human groups.   The second
problem is how to label the outputs of the memory module.   Usually, one can either directly score the
20

---


<!-- Page 21 -->

results [ 6 ] or make comparisons between two candidates [ 95 ].   The former can obtain absolute and
quantitative evaluation results, while the latter can remove the labeling noises when independently
scoring each candidate.   In addition, the granularity of the ratings should also be carefully designed.
Too coarse ratings may not effectively discriminate the capabilities of different memory modules,
while too fine-grained ones may bring more effort for the workers to make judgments.
In   general,   subjective   evaluation   can   be   used   in   a   wide   range   of   scenarios,   where   one   just   needs
to define the evaluation aspects and let recruited workers make judgments.   This method is usually
more explainable since the workers can provide the reasons for their judgments.   However, subjective
evaluation is costly due to the need to employ human evaluators.   Additionally, different groups of
evaluators may have various biases, making the results difficult to reproduce and compare.
6.1.2
Objective Evaluation
In objective evaluation, previous work usually defines numeric metrics to evaluate the effectiveness
and efficiency of the memory module.
Result Correctness.   This metric measures whether the agent can successfully answer pre-defined
questions directly based on the memory module.   For example, the question could be "Where did
Alice go today?" with two choices "A: the Summer Palace" and "B: the Great Wall".   Then, the agent
should choose the correct answer based on the problem and its memory.   The agent-generated answer
will be compared with the ground truth.   Formally, the accuracy can be calculated as
Correctness  =   1
N
N
�
i =1
I  [ a i   = ˆ a i ]  ,
where  N   is the number of problems,  a i  represents the ground truth for the  i -th problem,  ˆ a i  means the
answer given by the agent, and  I  [ a i   = ˆ a i ]  is the matching function commonly represented as
I  [ a i   = ˆ a i ] =
� 1
if  a i   = ˆ a i ,
0
if  a i   ̸ = ˆ a i .
In   previous   works,   Hu   et   al.   [96]   construct   questions   from   past   histories   with   annotated   ground
truths and calculate the accuracy of whether the recalled memory could match the correct answers.
Similarly,   Packer   et   al.   [100]   generate   questions   and   answers   that   can   only   be   derived   from   past
sessions, and compare the responses from the agents with the ground truths to calculate the accuracy.
Reference Accuracy.   This metric evaluates whether the agent can discover relevant memory contents
to answer the questions.   Different from the above metric, which focuses on the final results, reference
accuracy cares more about the intermediate information to support the agent’s final decisions.   In
specific, it compares the retrieved memory with the pre-prepared ground truth.   For the above problem
of "Where did Alice go today?", if the memory contents include (A) "Alice had lunch with friends at
Wangfujing  today." and (B) "Alice had roast duck for lunch", then a better memory module should
select (A) as a reference to answer the question.   Usually, researchers leverage F1-score to evaluate
the reference accuracy, which is calculated as
F1  = 2  ·   Precision  ·  Recall
Precision  +  Recall ,
where the precision and recall scores are calculated as  Precision  =
TP
TP + FP   and  Recall  =
TP
TP + FN .   The
TP  represents the number of true positive memory contents,  FP  means the number of false positive
memory contents, and  FN  indicates the number of false negative memory contents.   In previous works,
Lu et al.  [94]  utilize F1-score to evaluate the retrieval process of the memory, and Zhong et al.  [6]
focus on assessing whether related memory can be successfully retrieved.
Result   Correctness   and   Reference   Accuracy   are   both   utilized   to   evaluate   the   effectiveness   of   the
memory module.   Beyond effectiveness, efficiency is also an important aspect, especially for real-
world applications.   Therefore, we describe the evaluation of efficiency as follows.
Time & Hardware Cost.   The total time cost includes the time leveraged for memory adaption and
inference.   The adaptation time refers to the time of memory writing and memory management, while
the inference time indicates the time latency of memory reading.   In specific, the difference from the
21

<!-- Page 22 -->

end time to the start time of memory operations can be considered as the time consumption.   Formally,
the average time consumption of each type of operation can be represented as
∆ time  =   1
M
M
�
i =1
t end
i
− t start
i
,
where  M   represents the number of these operations,  t end
i
means the end time of the  i -th operation, and
t start
i
indicates the start time of that operation.   As for the computation overhead, it can be evaluated
by the peak GPU memory allocation.   In previous works, Tack et al.  [106]  utilize the peak memory
allocation and adaptation time to assess the efficiency of memory operations.
Objective evaluation offers numeric strategies to compare different methods of memory, which is
important to benchmark this field and promote future developments.
6.2
Indirect Evaluation
Besides the above method that directly evaluates the memory module, evaluating via task completion
is   also   a   popular   evaluation   strategy.   The   intuition   behind   this   type   of   approaches   is   that   if   the
agent can successfully complete a task that highly depends on memory, it suggests that the designed
memory module is effective.   In the following parts, we present several representative tasks that are
leveraged to evaluate the memory module in indirect ways.
6.2.1
Conversation
Engaging in conversations with humans is one of the most important applications of agents, where
memory plays a crucial role in this process.   By storing context information in memory, the agents
allow users to experience personalized conversations, thus improving users’ satisfaction.   Therefore,
when other parts of the agents are determined, the performance of the conversation tasks can reflect
the effectiveness of different memory modules.
In   the   context   of   conversation,   consistency   and   engagement   are   two   commonly   used   methods   to
evaluate the effectiveness of the agents’ memory.   Consistency refers to how the response from agents
is consistent with the context because dramatic changes should be avoided during the conversation.
For example, Lu et al.  [94]  evaluate the consistency of agents on interactive dialogues, using GPT-4
to score on the responses from agents.   Engagement refers to how the user is engaged to continue the
conversation.   It reflects the quality and attraction of agents’ responses, as well as the ability of agents
to craft the personas for current conversations.   For example, Lee et al.  [101]  assess the engagingness
of responses by SCE-p score,   and Packer et al.  [100]  utilize CSIM score to evaluate the memory
effect on increasing engagement of users.
6.2.2
Multi-source Question-answering
Multi-source questing-answering can comprehensively evaluate the memorized information from
multiple sources, including inside-trial information, cross-trial information, and external knowledge.
It focuses on the integration of memory utilization from various contents and sources.
In previous works, Yao et al.  [104]  evaluate the memory that integrates information from the task
trial and the external knowledge from Wikipedia.   Then, Shinn et al.  [5]  and Yao et al.  [103]  further
include the cross-trial information of the same task, where the memory is permitted to obtain more
experiences   from   previous   failed   trials.   Moreover,   Packer   et   al.   [100]   allow   agents   to   utilize   the
memory from multi-document information for question-answering.
By evaluating multi-source question-answering tasks, the memory of agents can be examined on
the capability of content integration from various sources.   It also reveals the issue of the memory
contradiction due to multiple information sources, and the problem of updated knowledge, which can
potentially affect the performance of the memory module.
6.2.3
Long-context Applications
Beyond the above general applications, in many scenarios, LLM-based agents have to make decisions
based on extremely long prompts.   In these scenarios, the long prompts are usually regarded as the
memory contents, which play an important role in driving agent behaviors.
22

---


<!-- Page 23 -->

In previous works, Huang et al.  [19]  organize a comprehensive survey for long-context LLMs, which
provides a summary of evaluation metrics on long-context scenarios.   Moreover, Shaham et al.  [138]
propose a zero-shot benchmark for evaluating agents’ understanding of long-context natural languages.
As for specific long-context tasks, long-context passage retrieval is one of the important tasks for
evaluating the long-context ability of agents.   It requires agents to find the correct paragraph in a long
context that corresponds to the given questions or descriptions [ 139 ].   Long-context summarization
is another representative task.   It requests agents to formulate a global understanding of the whole
context, and summarizes it according to the descriptions, where some metrics on matching scores
like ROUGE can be utilized to compare the results with ground truths.
The evaluation of long-context applications provides broader approaches to assess the function of
memory in agents, focusing on practical downstream scenarios.   The comprehensive benchmarks [ 138 ,
140] also provide an objective assessment for the ability of long-context understanding.
6.2.4
Other Tasks
In addition to the above three types of major tasks for indirect evaluation, there are also some other
metrics in general tasks that can reveal the effectiveness of the memory module.
Success   rate   refers   to   the   proportion   of   tasks   that   agents   can   successfully   solve.   For   Yao   et   al.
[104] ,   Shinn   et   al.   [5]   and   Zhao   et   al.   [82] ,   they   assess   how   many   spacial   tasks   can   be   correctly
completed through reasoning and memory in AlfWorld [ 141 ].   In Zhu et al.  [93] , they evaluate the
success rate of producing different items in Minecraft to show the effect of memory.   Moreover, Shinn
et   al.   [5]   measure   the   success   rate   of   passed   problems   by   generated   codes,   and   Zheng   et   al.   [91]
calculate the success rate of computer control and accuracy of element selection to show the function
of trajectory-as-exemplar memory.   Exploration degree typically appears in exploratory games, which
reflects the extent that agents can explore the environment.   For example, Wang et al.  [99]  compare
the numbers of distinct items explored in Minecraft to reflect the skill learning in memory.
In fact, nearly all the memory-equipped agents can evaluate the effect of memory by ablation studies,
comparing   the   performance   between   with/without   memory   modules.   The   evaluation   on   specific
scenarios can better reflect the significance of memory for the downstream applications practically.
6.3
Discussions
Compared with direct evaluation, indirect evaluation via specific tasks can be easier to conduct, since
there are already many public benchmarks.   However, the performance on tasks can be attributed
to various factors, and memory is only one of them, which may make the evaluation results biased.
By   direct   evaluation,   the   effectiveness   of   the   memory   module   can   be   independently   evaluated,
which improves the reliability of the evaluation results.   However, to our knowledge, there are no
open-sourced benchmarks tailored for the memory modules in LLM-based agents.

Memory-enhanced Agent Applications
Recently, LLM-based agents have been investigated across a wide variety of scenarios, facilitating
societal   advancement.   In   general,   most   LLM-based   agents   are   equipped   with   memory   modules.
However, the specific effects undertaken by these memory components, the particular information
they store, and the implementation methods they use, vary across different applications.   In order to
provide insights for the design of memory functionalities in LLM-based agents, in this section, we
review and summarize how memory mechanisms are manifested in LLM-based agents across various
application scenarios.   In specific, we categorize them into several classes:   role-playing and social
simulation, personal assistant, open-world games, code generation, recommendation, expert systems
in specific domains, and other applications.   The summarization is shown in  Table 4 .
7.1
Role-playing and Social Simulation
Role-playing represents a classic application of LLM-based agents, where memory plays a crucial role
inside the agents.   It endows roles with distinct characteristics, differentiating them from one another.
Many previous studies have explored methods for constructing role memories [ 105 ,  143 ,  145 – 147 ].
Shao   et   al.   [105]   construct   the   memory   of   roles   by   experience   uploading,   which   utilizes   SFT   to
inject memory into model parameters.   Li et al.  [143]  enhance large language models for role-playing
via an improved prompt and the character memory extracted from scripts, where user queries and
23

Table 4:   Summarization of memory-enhanced agents applications.
chatbot’s   responses   are   concatenated   to   form   a   sequence   as   memory.   Wang   et   al.   [145]   infuse
role-specific   knowledge   and   episode   memories   into   LLM-based   agents,   where   context   QA   pairs
are concatenated to form episode memory.   Zhao et al.  [146]  aim to generate human-like responses,
guided by personality traits extracted from narratives, which can be stored and retrieved by relevance
and importance.   Zhou et al.  [147]  generate character-based dialogues for different roles and empower
LLM-based agents with corresponding styles by SFT.
Social   simulation   is   basically   an   extension   of   role-playing,   which   focuses   more   on   multi-agent
modeling.   The memory module is an important component for such applications, which helps to
accurately   simulate   human   dynamic   behaviors.   In   previous   studies,   Kaiya   et   al.   [148]   propose   a
Summarize-and-Forget memory mechanism for better self-monitoring in social scenarios.   Gao et al.
[2]  focus on social network simulation systems.   Each agent in the system has a memory pool, which
consists of diverse user messages from online platforms to identify the user.   Li et al.  [163]  maintain
conversation contexts, encompassing the economic environment and agent decisions from previous
months, in order to simulate the impact of broad macroeconomic trends on agents’ decision-making
and to make the agents grasp market dynamics.   Li et al.  [109]  simulate the job-seeking scenario
in human society, where the memory of agents includes profiles and goals initially and is further
enriched with other information, like dialogues and personal reflections.   Hua et al.  [150]  simulate the
decisions and consequences of the participating countries in the wars, where the conversations of
agents are continuously maintained into memory.
There are several insights in designing an agent’s memory for role-play and social simulation.   First,
the memory should be consistent with the roles’ characteristics, which can be used to identify each
role and distinguish it from the others.   This is crucial for improving the realism of role-play and the
diversity of social simulation.   Second, the memory should appropriately influence the subsequent

actions   of   the   agent   to   ensure   the   consistency   and   rationality   of   its   behaviors.   Additionally,   for
humanoid agents, their memory mechanisms should align with the features of human memory, such
as forgetting and long/short-term memory, which should refer to the theories of cognitive psychology.
7.2
Personal Assistant
LLM-based agents are well-suited for creating personal assistants, such as agents capable of engaging
in   long-term   conversations   with   users   [ 94 ,   101 ,   153 ],   as   well   as   those   tasked   with   automatically
seeking information [ 164 ].   These agents often need to memorize previous dialogues to maintain
the consistency, and remember critical styles and events to generate more personalized and relevant
responses.   Lu   et   al.   [94]   maintain   the   context   consistency   for   dialogues   by   saving   contents   and
information of conversations, which helps to find proper relevant information by retrieval.   Lee et al.
[101]  summarize conversations to extract important information, store it, and retrieve it for future
inference.   Pan et al.  [164]  focus on information-seeking tasks, which design memory modules to
store user’s context information, and empower external knowledge with tool usage.   Wu et al.  [153]
retain important context as memory to maintain conversation consistency.
In summary, most memory implementations for personal assistants adopt retrieval methods in textual
form, because they are better at finding relevant information from pieces of conversations.   For the
memory storage, the agent should remember the factual information during user-agent interactions,
as well as the personal style of users, in order to generate responses that are tailored to the user’s
situation.   Additionally, when recalling memories, the agent should identify and retrieve the memory
that is relevant to the current query and context.   This principle can enable the agent to correctly
understand the user’s requirement, and maintain the consistency in conversations.
7.3
Open-world Game
For games and open-world exploration, LLM-based agents always maintain post observations as
task contexts, and store experiences in previous successful trials.   By leveraging past experiences,
agents can avoid making the same mistakes repeatedly and achieve a high-level understanding of
environments,   thus   exploring   more   effectively.   Some   of   them   can   acquire   external   databases   or
APIs   to   obtain   general   knowledge   [ 99 ,   93 ,   159 ,   161 ].   Wang   et   al.   [99]   save   obtained   skills   into
memory   for   further   usage   in   Minecraft.   Zhu   et   al.   [93]   store   and   retrieve   successful   trajectories
as examples for similar tasks, and utilize external Minecraft Wiki by API calls.   Wang et al.  [159]
construct multimodal memory as a knowledge library and provide examples for prompt by retrieving
interactive experiences.   Yan et al.  [161]  maintain working memory for decision-making, save and
retrieve relevant past experiences, and implement external datasets for general knowledge.
In summary, no matter inside-trial or cross-trial information, the key aspect of memory is to reflect on
past interactions and draw experiences that can be applied to the subsequent exploration.   In addition
to accumulating experience through self-involving trials, absorbing external knowledge as part of the
agent’s memory is also an important way to enhance the exploratory capabilities of the agent.
7.4
Code Generation
In   the   scenario   of   code   generation,   LLM-based   agents   can   search   relevant   information   from   the
memory, thereby obtaining more knowledge for development.   They can save previous experiences for
future problems, and also maintain context in conversational development interfaces [ 142 ,  144 ,  1 ,  109 ].
Tsai et al.  [142]  construct an external non-parametric memory database, which stores the compiler
errors and human expert instructions for automatic syntax error fixing.   In [ 144 ], personal information
will be stored in the memory, and helps in retaining context and knowledge for decision-making.
Qian et al.  [1]  adopt multi-agents to develop software, where each role maintains a memory to store
the past conversations with other roles.   Li et al.  [109]  also focus on software development, and the
agent can retrieve its historical records preserved in memory when errors occur.   Zhang et al.  [114]
can search relevant information when they face problems on code generation.
By   leveraging   external   resources,   the   agents   can   learn   from   code-related   knowledge   and   store   it
into their memory, thereby enhancing the capabilities of code generation.   In addition, the memory
can improve the continuity and consistency in code generation.   By integrating contextual memory,
the agent can better understand the requirements for software development, thereby enhancing the
coherence of the generated code. Furthermore, the memory is also crucial for the iterative optimization
of code, as it can identify the developer’s targets based on the histories.

Recommendation
In the field of recommendation, some previous works focus on simulating users in recommender
systems   [ 95 ,   108 ],   where   the   memory   can   represent   the   user   profiles   and   histories   in   the   real
world.   Others   try   to   improve   the   performance   of   recommendation,   or   provide   other   formats   of
recommendation interfaces [ 149 ,  102 ].   Wang et al.  [95]  simulate user behaviors in recommendation
scenarios   to   generate   data   for   recommender   systems,   and   the   agents   store   past   observations   and
insights into a hierarchical memory.   In Huang et al.  [108] , the memory in LLM-based agents can
archive the user’s conversational history over extended periods, as well as capture the most recent
dialogues   pertinent   to   the   current   prompt,   to   simulate   interactive   recommender   systems.   It   also
uses an actor-critic reflection to improve the robustness of agents.   Item agents and user agents are
equipped with different memories in [ 149 ], where item agents are endowed with dynamic memory
modules designed to capture and preserve information pertinent to their intrinsic attributes and the
inclinations of their adopters.   For user agents, the adaptive memory updating mechanism plays a
pivotal role in aligning the agents’ operations with user behaviors and preferences.   Wang et al.  [102]
memorize   individualized   user   information   like   reviews   or   ratings   for   items,   and   acquire   domain-
specific knowledge and real-time information by web searching tools.
For both simulating users in recommender systems and capturing their preferences, retaining per-
sonalized   information   through   memory   is   essential.   A   critical   challenge   lies   in   how   to   align   the
personalized information and feedback with LLMs, and store them into the memory of agents.   It is
also an important task for bridging the gap between conventional recommendation models and LLMs.
7.6
Expert System in Specific Domains
Medicine Domain.   In the field of medicine, most of the previous works empower LLM-based agents
with   external   knowledge   in   their   memory   [ 107 ,   129 ,   132 ,   151 ,   115 ].   Wang   et   al.   [107]   fine-tune
LLaMA   [ 127 ]   with   medical   knowledge   graph   CMeKG   [ 165 ]   in   QA   form,   in   order   to   enhance
their   medical   domain   knowledge.   Xiong   et   al.   [129]   adopt   LoRA   [ 131 ]   to   efficiently   fine-tune
on   foundation   models   for   healthcare.   Wang   et   al.   [151]   empower   LLM-based   agents   to   acquire
text-based external knowledge as reasoning reference.   Besides, Shi et al.  [152]  build memory upon
the most relevant successful cases from past experiences, and use similarity metric for the retrieval of
relevant questions in the medicine domain.
Finance Domain.   Some previous works also apply LLM-based agents in the finance domain, whose
memory can store financial knowledge [113], market information [154, 156], and successful experi-
ences [ 157 ,  155 ].   Yang et al.  [113]  construct financial investment dataset to fine-tune LLaMA [ 127 ]
to empower knowledge on investment.   Li et al.  [154]  design a layered-memory structure to store
different   types   of   marketing   information.   Wang   et   al.   [155]   record   the   ongoing   interaction   like
exchanges and information to ensure consistent response, and record prior outputs as experiences for
retrieving relevant examples to provide a diverse learning context for agents.   Koa et al.  [157]  store
past price movement and explanations, and generate reflections on previous trials.   Yu et al.  [156]
adopt a layered memory mechanism to provide abundant information for reasoning.
Science.   In   the   domain   of   science,   some   existing   works   design   LLM-based   agents   with   a   large
amount   of   knowledge   in   memory   to   solve   problems   [ 158 ,   160 ,   162 ].   Chen   et   al.   [158]   include
molecule database and online literature as external knowledge for memory in LLM-based agents, and
retrieve them when they need related information.   Zhao et al.  [160]  and Chen et al.  [162]  empower
domain knowledge by fine-tuning in Chemistry and structured materials respectively.
To build an expert system based on agents in a specific vertical domain, it is necessary to retain the
domain-specific knowledge in their memory.   However, there are several challenges.   First, domain
knowledge is specialized and requires higher accuracy, leading to difficulties in constructing memory
storage.   Second,   domain   knowledge   is   often   time-sensitive,   which   can   become   outdated   in   the
future.   Therefore, the memory needs to be partially updated when some of the knowledge has been
out-of-date.   Furthermore, the substantial volume of domain knowledge makes it difficult to recall
from memory based on the current query.
7.7
Other Applications
There are some other applications of memory in LLM-based agents.   Wang et al.  [166]  focus on the
task of cloud root cause analysis, using memory to store framework rules, task requirements, tools
26

<!-- Page 27 -->

documentation, few-shot examples, and agent observations.   Qiang et al.  [167]  solve the problem
of ontology matching.   The agents save conversational dialogues and construct a rational database
for retrieving external knowledge.   Wen et al.  [168]  investigate autonomous driving, whose memory
module is constructed by a vector database and contains the experiences from past driving scenarios.
Wang   et   al.   [169]   propose   to   improve   user   acceptance   testing,   which   employs   a   self-reflection
mechanism.   After   each   trial,   the   operation   agent   summarizes   the   conversation   and   updates   the
memory pool, until the goal of the current step is accomplished.
For different applications, the focus of memory varies, as it inherently serves the downstream tasks.
Therefore, the design should also consider the requirements of tasks.

Limitations & Future Directions
8.1
More Advances in Parametric Memory
At   present,   the   memory   of   LLM-based   agents   is   predominantly   in   textual   form,   especially   for
contextual knowledge such as observation records, trial experiences, and textual knowledge databases.
Although textual memory possesses the advantages of being interpretable and easy to expand and
edit, it also implies a sacrifice in efficiency compared to parametric memory.   Essentially, parametric
memory boasts a higher information density, expressing semantics through continuous real-number
vectors in a latent space, whereas textual memory employs a combination of tokens in a discrete
space for semantic expression.   Thus, parametric memory offers a richer expressive space, and its
soft encoding is more robust compared to the hard-coded form of token sequences.   Additionally,
parametric memory is more storage-efficient, where it does not require the explicit storage of extensive
texts, similar to a knowledge compression process.   As for the memory management, such as merging
and reflection, parametric memory does not necessarily design manual rules like textual memory
does, but can employ optimization methods to learn these processes implicitly.   Moreover, pluggable
parametric memory is similar to a digital life card, capable of endowing agents with the requisite
characteristics.   For example, Huatuo [ 107 ] aims to enhance agents with expertise in the biomedical
field   by   refining   the   Llama   [ 127 ]   model   on   Chinese   medical   knowledge   bases.   MAC   [ 106 ]   is
designed to create a parametric memory adaptation framework suitable for online settings, employing
meta-learning techniques to replace the traditional optimization phase.
Although parametric memory holds great prospects, it currently faces numerous challenges.   Foremost
among these is the issue of efficiency: how to effectively transform textual information into parameters
or modifications of parameters is a critical question.   Presently, researchers can transfer vast amounts
of   domain   knowledge   into   the   parameters   of   LLMs   by   SFT.   However,   it   is   time-consuming   and
requires extensive text corpus, making it unsuitable for situational knowledge.   One viable approach
is to employ meta-learning to let models learn to memorize.   For example, MEND [ 134 ] leverages the
method of meta-learning to train a compact model that has the ability to produce adjustments for the
parameters of a pre-trained language model.   Moreover, the lack of interpretability associated with
parametric memory can be a hindrance, especially in domains requiring high levels of trust, such as
medicine.   Therefore, enhancing the credibility and interpretability of parametric memory is an urgent
issue that needs to be addressed.
8.2
Memory in LLM-based Multi-agent Applications
The exploration of memory mechanisms within LLMs has burgeoned into the dynamic domain of
multi-agent systems (MAS), marking significant advancements in the realms of synchronization,
communication, and the management of information asymmetry.   One pivotal aspect that emerges in
the cooperative scenarios is memory synchronization among agents.   This process is fundamental
for establishing a unified knowledge base, ensuring consistency in decision-making across different
agents.   For   example,   Chen   et   al.   [170]   emphasize   the   significance   of   integrating   synchronized
memory   modules   for   multi-robot   collaboration.   Another   important   aspect   is   the   communication
among agents, which heavily relies on memory for maintaining context and interpreting messages.
For example, Mandi et al.  [171]  illustrate memory-driven communication frameworks that foster a
common understanding among agents.   In addition to cooperative scenarios, some studies also focus
on competitive scenarios, and the information asymmetry becomes a crucial issue [172].
Looking   ahead,   the   advancement   of   memory   in   LLM-based   MAS   is   poised   at   the   confluence   of
technological   innovation   and   strategic   application.   It   beckons   the   exploration   of   novel   memory
27

<!-- Page 28 -->

modules that can further enhance agent synchronization, enable more effective communication, and
provide strategic advantages in information-rich environments.   The development of such memory
models would not only necessitate addressing the current challenges of memory integration and man-
agement, but also explore the untapped potentials of memory in facilitating more robust, intelligent,
and adaptable MAS. As evidenced by pioneering research, the evolving landscape of LLM-based
MAS sets a promising stage for future innovations in memory utilization and management.   This
exploration is expected to unravel new dimensions of memory integration, pushing the boundaries of
what is currently achievable and setting new benchmarks in the realm of MAS.
8.3
Memory-based Lifelong Learning
Lifelong learning is an advanced topic in artificial intelligence, extending the learning capabilities of
agents across their life-long span [ 173 ].   Agents can continuously interact with their environment,
persistently observe environments, and acquire external knowledge, enabling a mode of enhancement
like humans.   The memory of an agent is key to achieving lifelong learning, as it needs to learn to store
and apply the past observations.   Lifelong learning in LLM-based agents holds significant practical
value, such as in long-term social simulations and personal assistance.   However, it also faces several
challenges.   Firstly,   lifelong   learning   is   temporal,   necessitating   that   an   agent’s   memory   captures
temporality.   This temporality could cause interactions between memories, such as memory overlap.
Furthermore,   due   to   the   extended   period   of   lifelong   learning,   it   needs   to   store   a   vast   amount   of
memories and retrieve them when needed, possibly incorporating a certain mechanism for forgetting.
8.4
Memory in Humanoid Agent
A humanoid agent refers to an agent designed to exhibit behaviors consistent with humans, thereby
facilitating applications in social simulation, studies of human behavior, and role-playing.   Unlike
task-oriented agents where greater capability is typically preferred, the proficiency of a humanoid
agent should closely mimic that of humans.   Consequently, the memory of humanoid agents should
align with human cognitive processes, adhering to psychological principles such as memory distortion
and forgetfulness. Additionally, humanoid agents should possess knowledge boundaries, meaning that
their knowledge should correspond to that of the entity they replicate.   For instance, in role-playing
scenarios, an agent embodying a child should not possess an understanding of advanced mathematical
concepts or other complex knowledge beyond what is typical for that age [174].

Conclusion
In this survey, we provide a systematical review on the memory mechanism of LLM-based agents,
where we focus on three key problems including "What is", "Why do we need" and "How to design
and evaluate" the memory module in LLM-based agents.   To show the importance of the agent’s
memory, we also present many typical applications, where the memory module plays an important
role.   We believe this survey can offer valuable references for newcomers to this domain, and also
hope it can inspire more advanced memory mechanisms to enhance LLM-based agents.
