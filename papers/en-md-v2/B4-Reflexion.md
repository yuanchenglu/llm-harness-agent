Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to interact with exter-
nal environments (e.g., games, compilers, APIs) as goal-driven agents.   However,
it remains challenging for these language agents to quickly and efficiently learn
from trial-and-error as traditional reinforcement learning methods require exten-
sive training samples and expensive model fine-tuning.   We propose  Reflexion , a
novel   framework   to   reinforce   language   agents   not   by   updating   weights,   but   in-
stead through linguistic feedback.   Concretely, Reflexion agents verbally reflect
on   task   feedback   signals,   then   maintain   their   own   reflective   text   in   an   episodic
memory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent trials.   Reflexion is
flexible enough to incorporate various types (scalar values or free-form language)
and   sources   (external   or   internally   simulated)   of   feedback   signals,   and   obtains
significant   improvements   over   a baseline   agent   across   diverse   tasks (sequential
decision-making, coding, language reasoning).   For example, Reflexion achieves a
91% pass@1 accuracy on the HumanEval coding benchmark, surpassing the previ-
ous state-of-the-art GPT-4 that achieves 80%. We also conduct ablation and analysis
studies using different feedback signals, feedback incorporation methods, and agent
types, and provide insights into how they affect performance.   We release all code,
demos, and datasets at  https://github.com/noahshinn024/reflexion .

Introduction
Recent   works   such   as   ReAct   [ 30 ],   SayCan   [ 1 ],   Toolformer   [ 22 ],   HuggingGPT   [ 23 ],   generative
agents [ 19 ], and WebGPT [ 17 ] have demonstrated the feasibility of autonomous decision-making
agents that are built on top of a large language model (LLM) core.   These methods use LLMs to
generate   text   and   ‘actions‘   that   can   be   used   in   API   calls   and   executed   in   an   environment.   Since
they rely on massive models with an enormous number of parameters, such approaches have been
so far limited to using in-context examples as a way of teaching the agents, since more traditional
optimization schemes like reinforcement learning with gradient descent require substantial amounts
of compute and time.
Preprint.   Under review.

In this paper, we propose an alternative approach called  Reflexion  that uses verbal reinforcement
to   help   agents   learn   from   prior   failings.   Reflexion   converts   binary   or   scalar   feedback   from   the
environment into verbal feedback in the form of a textual summary, which is then added as additional
context   for the   LLM agent   in the   next   episode.   This   self-reflective   feedback acts   as a   ‘semantic’
gradient signal by providing the agent with a concrete direction to improve upon, helping it learn
from prior mistakes to perform better on the task.   This is akin to how humans iteratively learn to
accomplish complex tasks in a few-shot manner – by reflecting on their previous failures in order to
form an improved plan of attack for the next attempt.   For example, in figure 1, a Reflexion agent
learns to optimize its own behavior to solve decision-making, programming, and reasoning tasks
through trial, error, and self-reflection.
Generating useful reflective feedback is challenging since it requires a good understanding of where
the model made mistakes (i.e.   the credit assignment problem [ 25 ]) as well as the ability to generate
a   summary   containing   actionable   insights   for   improvement.   We   explore   three   ways   for   doing
this – simple binary environment feedback,   pre-defined heuristics for common failure cases,   and
self-evaluation   such   as   binary   classification   using   LLMs   (decision-making)   or   self-written   unit
tests (programming).   In all implementations, the evaluation signal is amplified to natural language
experience summaries which can be stored in long-term memory.
Reflexion has several advantages compared to more traditional RL approaches like policy or value-
based learning:   1) it is lightweight and doesn’t require finetuning the LLM, 2) it allows for more
nuanced forms of feedback (e.g.   targeted changes in actions), compared to scalar or vector rewards
that are challenging to perform accurate credit assignment with, 3) it allows for a more explicit and
interpretable form of episodic memory over prior experiences, and 4) it provides more explicit hints
for actions in future episodes.   At the same time, it does have the disadvantages of relying on the
power of the LLM’s self-evaluation capabilities (or heuristics) and not having a formal guarantee for
success.   However, as LLM capabilities improve, we only expect this paradigm to get better over time.
We perform experiments on (1) decision-making tasks to test sequential action choices over long
trajectories, (2) reasoning tasks to test knowledge-intensive, single-step generation improvement,
and   (3)   programming   tasks   to   teach   the   agent   to   effectively   use   external   tools   such   as   compilers
and interpreters.   Across all three types of tasks, we observe Reflexion agents are better decision-
makers, reasoners, and programmers.   More concretely, Reflexion agents improve on decision-making
AlfWorld [ 24 ] tasks over strong baseline approaches by an absolute 22% in 12 iterative learning
steps,   and on reasoning questions in HotPotQA [ 28 ] by 20%,   and Python programming tasks on
HumanEval [6] by as much as 11%.
To summarize, our contributions are the following:
•   We   propose   Reflexion,   a   new   paradigm   for   ‘verbal‘   reinforcement   that   parameterizes   a
policy as an agent’s memory encoding paired with a choice of LLM parameters.
•   We explore this emergent property of  self-reflection  in LLMs and empirically show that
self-reflection is extremely useful to learn complex tasks over a handful of trials.
•   We introduce LeetcodeHardGym, a code-generation RL gym environment consisting of 40
challenging Leetcode questions (‘hard-level‘) in 19 programming languages.
•   We show that Reflexion achieves improvements over strong baselines across several tasks,
and achieves state-of-the-art results on various code generation benchmarks.

[16]  use decider models to reason over several generations.   Kim et al.  [10]  use a retry pattern over
a fixed number of steps without an evaluation step.   Goodman  [9]  perform a qualitative evaluation
step that proposes optimizations to the previous generation.   In this paper, we show that several of
these concepts can be enhanced with  self-reflection  to build a persisting memory of self-reflective
experiences which allows an agent to identify its own errors and self-suggest lessons to learn from its
mistakes over time.
Programming
Several   past   and   recent   works   employ   variations   of   test-driven   development   or
code   debugging   practices.   AlphaCode   [ 14 ]   evaluates   a   set   of   generations   on   hidden   test   cases.
CodeT [ 5 ] uses self-generated unit tests that are used to score generated function implementations.
Self-Debugging [ 7 ] employs a debugging component that is used to improve existing implementations
given feedback from a code execution environment.   CodeRL [ 12 ] sets the problem in an RL frame-
work using an actor-critic setup to debug programs given feedback from an execution environment.
AlphaCode, Self-Debugging and CodeRL are effective in fixing less-complex program bugs, but they
rely upon ground truth test cases that invalidate pass@1 eligibility, and do not use self-reflection to
bridge the gap between error identification and implementation improvement.   CodeT does not access
hidden test cases but does not implement a self-learning step to improve code writing.

Reflexion:   reinforcement via verbal reflection
We develop a modular formulation for Reflexion, utilizing three distinct models:   an  Actor , denoted as
M a , which generates text and actions; an  Evaluator  model, represented by  M e , that scores the outputs
produced by  M a ; and a  Self-Reflection  model, denoted as  M sr , which generates verbal reinforcement
cues   to   assist   the   Actor   in   self-improvement.   We   provide   a   detailed   description   of   each   of   these
models and subsequently elucidate their collaborative functioning within the Reflexion framework.

Actor
The   Actor   is   built   upon   a   large   language   model   (LLM)   that   is   specifically   prompted   to
generate the necessary text and actions conditioned on the state observations.   Analogous to traditional
policy-based RL setups, we sample an action or generation,  a t , from the current policy  π θ   at time  t ,
receive an observation from the environment  o t .   We explore various Actor models, including Chain of
Thought [ 26 ] and ReAct [ 30 ].   These diverse generation models allow us to explore different aspects
of text and action generation within the Reflexion framework, providing valuable insights into their
performance and effectiveness.   In addition, we also add a memory component  mem  that provides
additional context to this agent.   This adaption was inspired by Brooks et al.  [3] , who suggest a policy
iteration approach using in-context learning.   Details on how this is populated are provided below.
Evaluator
The Evaluator component of the Reflexion framework plays a crucial role in assessing
the quality of the generated outputs produced by the Actor.   It takes as input a generated trajectory
and computes a reward score that reflects its performance within the given task context.   Defining
effective   value   and   reward   functions   that   apply   to   semantic   spaces   is   difficult,   so   we   investigate
several variants of the Evaluator model.   For reasoning tasks,   we explore reward functions based
on exact match (EM) grading, ensuring that the generated output aligns closely with the expected
solution.   In decision-making tasks, we employ pre-defined heuristic functions that are tailored to
specific evaluation criteria.   Additionally, we experiment with using a different instantiation of an
LLM itself as an Evaluator, generating rewards for decision-making and programming tasks.   This
multi-faceted   approach   to   Evaluator   design   allows   us   to   examine   different   strategies   for   scoring
generated outputs, offering insights into their effectiveness and suitability across a range of tasks.
Self-reflection
The   Self-Reflection   model   instantiated   as   an   LLM,   plays   a   crucial   role   in   the
Reflexion framework by generating verbal self-reflections to provide valuable feedback for future
trials. Given a sparse reward signal, such as a binary success status (success/fail), the current trajectory,
and its persistent memory  mem , the self-reflection model generates nuanced and specific feedback.
This feedback, which is more informative than scalar rewards, is then stored in the agent’s memory
( mem ).   For instance, in a multi-step decision-making task, when the agent receives a failure signal, it
can infer that a specific action  a i  led to subsequent incorrect actions  a i +1  and  a i +2 .   The agent can
then verbally state that it should have taken a different action,  a ′
i , which would have resulted in  a ′
i +1
and  a ′
i +2 , and store this experience in its memory.   In subsequent trials, the agent can leverage its past
experiences to adapt its decision-making approach at time  t  by choosing action  a ′
i .   This iterative
process of trial, error, self-reflection, and persisting memory enables the agent to rapidly improve its
decision-making ability in various environments by utilizing informative feedback signals.
Memory
Core components of the Reflexion process are the notion of short-term and long-term
memory.   At inference time, the Actor conditions its decisions on short and long-term memory, similar

to the way that humans remember fine-grain recent details while also recalling distilled important
experiences from long-term memory.   In the RL setup, the trajectory history serves as the short-term
memory while outputs from the Self-Reflection model are stored in long-term memory.   These two
memory components work together to provide context that is specific but also influenced by lessons
learned   over   several   trials,   which   is   a   key   advantage   of   Reflexion   agents   over   other   LLM   action
choice works.
The Reflexion process
Reflexion is formalized as an iterative optimization process in 1.   In the
first trial, the Actor produces a trajectory  τ 0   by interacting with the environment.   The Evaluator then
produces a score  r 0   which is computed as  r t   =   M e ( τ 0 ) .   r t   is only a scalar reward for trial  t  that
improves as task-specific performance increases.   After the first trial, to amplify  r 0  to a feedback form
that can be used for improvement by an LLM, the Self-Reflection model analyzes the set of  { τ 0 , r 0 }
to produce a summary  sr 0  which is stored in the memory  mem .   sr t   is a verbal experience feedback
for trial  t .   The Actor, Evaluator, and Self-Reflection models work together through trials in a loop
until the Evaluator deems  τ t  to be correct.   As mentioned in 3, the memory component of Reflexion
is crucial to its effectiveness.   After each trial  t ,  sr t , is appended  mem .   In practice, we bound  mem
by a maximum number of stored experiences,  Ω (usually set to 1-3) to adhere to max context LLM
limitations.

Experiments
We evaluate various natural language RL setups on decision-making, reasoning, and code generation
tasks.   Specifically, we challenge an agent to perform search-based question answering on HotPotQA
[28], multi-step tasks in common household environments in AlfWorld [24], and code writing tasks
in   competition-like   environments   with   interpreters   and   compilers   in   HumanEval   [ 6 ],   MBPP   [ 2 ],
and LeetcodeHard, a new benchmark.   Most notably, Reflexion improves performance over strong
baselines by 22% in AlfWorld, 20% in HotPotQA, and 11% on HumanEval.
4.1
Sequential decision making:   ALFWorld
AlfWorld   is   a   suite   of   text-based   environments   that   challenge   an   agent   to   solve   multi-step   tasks
in   a   variety   of   interactive   environments   based   on   TextWorld   [ 8 ].   Following   Yao   et   al.   [30] ,   we
run   the   agent   in   134   AlfWorld   environments   across   six   different   tasks,   including   finding   hidden
objects   (e.g.,   finding   a   spatula   in   a   drawer),   moving   objects   (e.g.,   moving   a   knife   to   the   cutting
board), and manipulating objects with other objects (e.g., chilling a tomato in the fridge).   We use
ReAct [ 30 ] as the action generator as Yao et al.  [30]  has shown success in long trajectory decision-
making using explicit intermediate thoughts.   AlfWorld tasks naturally require a self-evaluation step
as   the   environment   can   only   signal   if   a   task   is   complete.   To   achieve   fully   autonomous   behavior,
we implement two self-evaluation techniques:   natural language classification using an LLM and a
hand-written heuristic.   The heuristic is simple:   if the agent executes the same action and receives the
same response for more than 3 cycles, or if the number of actions taken in the current environment
exceeds 30 (inefficient planning), we self-reflect.   In the baseline runs, if self-reflection is suggested,
we skip the self-reflection process, reset the environment, and start a new trial.   In the Reflexion runs,
the agent uses self-reflection to find its mistake, update its memory, reset the environment, and start a
new trial.   To avoid very long prompt windows that may exceed the maximum limit, we truncate the
agent’s memory to the last 3 self-reflections (experiences).
To avoid syntactic errors, we provide two domain-specific few-shot trajectories to the agent.   We use
the same few-shot trajectory examples as Yao et al.  [30]  with GPT-3 for the LLM. AlfWorld tasks,
ReAct few-shot prompts, and Reflexion examples are included in the appendix.
Results
ReAct + Reflexion significantly outperforms ReAct by completing 130 out of 134 tasks
using the simple heuristic to detect hallucinations and inefficient planning.   Further, ReAct + Reflexion
learns to solve additional tasks by learning in 12 consecutive trials.   In the ReAct-only approach, we
see that performance increase halts between trials 6 and 7.
Analysis
A common error in baseline failed AlfWorld trajectories is when an agent thinks that it
has possession of an item but does not actually have the item.   The agent proceeds to execute several
actions in a long trajectory and is not able to backtrack its actions to find the mistake.   Reflexion

eliminates almost all of these cases by using self-reflection to distill long,   failed trajectories into
relevant experiences that can are used as "self-hints" in the future.   There are two main cases in which
long-term memory helps an agent in AlfWorld:   1) An early mistake in a long trajectory can be easily
identified.   The agent can suggest a new action choice or even a new long-term plan.   2) There are too
many surfaces/containers to check for an item.   The agent can exploit its experience memory over
several trials to thoroughly search a room.   In 3, the learning curve suggests that the learning process
occurs over several experiences, meaning that the agent is successfully balancing cases 1 and 2 shown
in the immediate spike in the improvement between the first two trials, then a steady increase over
the next 11 trials to a near-perfect performance.   On the other hand,   3 shows a ReAct-only agent
converging at a hallucination rate of 22% with no signs of long-term recovery.
4.2
Reasoning:   HotpotQA
HotPotQA [ 28 ] is a Wikipedia-based dataset with 113k question-and-answer pairs that challenge
agents   to   parse   content   and   reason   over   several   supporting   documents.   To   test   improvement   in
reasoning   only   ability,   we   implement   Reflexion   +   Chain-of-Thought   (CoT)   [ 26 ]   for   step-by-step
Q  → A  and  Q ,  C gt   → A  implementations, where  Q  is the question,  C gt   is the ground truth context
from the dataset, and  A  is the final answer.   Since CoT is not a multi-step decision-making technique,
we   give   C gt   to   the   agent   so   that   we   can   isolate   the   reasoning   behavior   over   large   sections   of   the
provided text.   To test holistic question and answering ability, which requires reasoning and action
choice,   we   implement   a   Reflexion   +   ReAct   [ 30 ]   agent   that   can   retrieve   relevant   context   using   a
Wikipedia API and infer answers using step-by-step explicit thinking.   For CoT implementations, we
use 6-shot prompting; for ReAct, we use 2-shot prompting, and for self-reflection, we use 2-shot
prompting.   All examples can be found in the appendix.
Robustly evaluating natural language answers is a long-standing problem in NLP. Therefore, between
trials, we use exact match answer grading using the environment to give a binary success signal to
the agent.   After each trial, the self-reflection loop is employed to amplify the binary signal, similar to
the decision-making setup 4.1 in AlfWorld with a memory size of 3 experiences.
Results
Reflexion outperforms all baseline approaches by significant margins over several learning
steps.   Furthermore, ReAct-only, CoT-only, and CoT (GT)-only implementations fail to probabilisti-
cally improve on any tasks, meaning that no failed tasks from the first trial from any of the baseline
approaches were able to be solved in subsequent trials using a temperature of 0.7 In the Reflexion runs,
we allowed the agent to gather experience and retry on failed tasks until it produced 3 consecutive
failed attempts on the particular task.   Naturally, the CoT (GT) achieved higher accuracy scores as it
was given access to the ground truth context of the question.   Still, the CoT (GT) agent is unable to
correctly infer the correct answer for 39% of the questions, but Reflexion helps the agent to correct
its mistakes without access to the ground truth answer to improve its accuracy by 14%.

Analysis
We perform an ablation experiment to isolate the advantage of the self-reflective step for
reasoning using CoT (GT) as the baseline approach 4.   Recall that CoT (GT) uses Chain-of-Thought
reasoning with provided ground truth context, which tests reasoning ability over long contexts.   Next,
we   add   an   element   of   episodic   memory   (EPM)   by   including   the   most   recent   trajectory.   For   the
Reflexion agent, we implement the standard self-reflection step as a final pass.   Intuitively, we test if
the agent is iteratively learning more effectively by using verbal explanation using language written
in   the   first   person.   4   shows   that   self-reflection   improves   learning   by   an   8%   absolute   boost   over
the episodic memory learning advantage.   This result supports the argument that refinement-only
approaches are not as effective as self-reflection-guided refinement approaches.
4.3
Programming
We   evaluate   the   baseline   and   Reflexion   approaches   on   Python   and   Rust   code   writing   on   MBPP
[ 2 ],   HumanEval   [ 6 ],   and   LeetcodeHardGym,   our   new   dataset.   MBPP   and   HumanEval   measure
function body generation accuracy given natural language descriptions. We use a benchmark language
compiler, MultiPL-E [ 4 ], to translate subsets of HumanEval and MBPP to the Rust language. MultiPL-
E is a collection of small compilers that can be used to translate Python benchmark questions to 18
other languages.   We include experiments for Rust code generation to demonstrate that Reflexion
implementations   for   code   generation   are   language-agnostic   and   can   be   used   for   interpreted   and
compiled   languages.   Lastly,   we   introduce   a   new   benchmark,   LeetcodeHardGym,   which   is   an
interactive programming gym that contains 40 Leetcode hard-rated questions that have been released
after October 8, 2022, which is the pre-training cutoff date of GPT-4 [18].
The task of programming presents a unique opportunity to use more grounded self-evaluation practices
such as self-generated unit test suites.   Thus, our Reflexion-based programming task implementation is
eligible for pass@1 accuracy reporting.   To generate a test suite, we use Chain-of-Thought prompting
[26] to produce diverse, extensive tests with corresponding natural language descriptions.   Then, we
filter for syntactically valid test statements by attempting to construct a valid abstract syntax tree
(AST) for each proposed test.   Finally, we sample  n  tests from the collection of generated unit tests
to produce a test suite  T , denoted as  { t 0 , t 1 , . . . , t n } .   We set  n  to a maximum of 6 unit tests.   Aside
from the unit test suite component, the setup for the learning loop for a Reflexion programming agent
is identical to the reasoning and decision-making agents with a max memory limit of 1 experience.

Results
Reflexion outperforms all baseline accuracies and sets new state-of-the-art standards on
all benchmarks for Python and Rust except for MBPP Python 1.   We further investigate the inferior
performance of Reflexion on MBPP Python.
Analysis
We acknowledge that self-reflecting code-generation agents are bound to their ability to
write diverse, comprehensive tests.   Therefore, in the case in which the model generates a flaky test
suite, it is possible that all tests pass on an incorrect solution and lead to a false positive label on a
code completion [ 11 ].   On the other hand, if the model produces an incorrectly written test suite, it
is possible for some of the tests to fail on a correct solution, leading to a self-reflection generation
that   is   conditioned   on   a   false   negative   code   completion.   Given   the   implementation   of   Reflexion,
false negatives are preferred over false positives as the agent may be able to use self-reflection to
identify the incorrect test(s) and prompt itself to keep the original code completion intact.   On the
other   hand,   if   an   invalid   test   suite   returns   a   false   positive   completion   (all   internal   test   cases   pass
but the implementation is incorrect), the agent will prematurely report an invalid submission.   In 2,
various conditions are measured to analyze performance beyond pass@1 accuracy.   Previously, we
displayed the inferior performance of Reflexion to the baseline GPT-4 on MBPP Python.   In 2, we
observe a notable discrepancy between the false positive labels produced by internal test execution,
P(not pass@1 generation correct | tests pass).   That is, the probability that a submission will fail given
that it passes all unit tests.   For HumanEval and MBPP Python, the baseline pass@1 accuracies are
relatively similar,   82% and 80%,   respectively.   However,   the false positive test execution rate for
MBPP Python is 16.3% while the rate for HumanEval Python is a mere 1.4%, leading to 91% overall
accuracy 1.

GPT-4 as the base model on HumanEval Rust - 50 hardest problems
Ablation study
We test the composite approach of Reflexion for test generation and self-reflection
cooperation on a subset of the 50 hardest HumanEval Rust problems.   Our Rust compiler environment
provides verbose error logs and helpful debugging hints,   therefore serving as a good playground
for   compromised   approaches.   First,   we   omit   internal   test   generation   and   execution   steps,   which
test the agent to self-reflect without guidance from current implementations.   3 shows an inferior
52% vs 60% (baseline) accuracy, which suggests that the agent is unable to determine if the current
implementation is correct without unit tests.   Therefore, the agent must participate in all iterations of
the run without the option to return early, performing harmful edits to the implementation.
Next, we test self-reflection contribution by omitting the natural language explanation step following
failed   unit   test   suite   evaluations.   Intuitively,   this   challenges   the   agent   to   combine   the   tasks   of
error identification and implementation improvement across all failed unit tests.   Interestingly, the
compromised agent does not improve performance over the baseline run.   We observe that the test
generation and code compilation steps are able to catch syntax and logic errors, but the implementation
fixes do not reflect these indications.   These empirical results suggest that several recent works that
8

propose  blind  trial and error debugging techniques without self-reflection are ineffective on harder
tasks such as writing complex programs in Rust.

Limitations
At its core, Reflexion is an optimization technique that uses natural language to do policy optimization.
Policy optimization is a powerful approach to improve action choice through experience, but it may
still succumb to non-optimal local minima solutions.   In this study, we limit long-term memory to
a   sliding   window   with   maximum   capacity,   but   we   encourage   future   work   to   extend   the   memory
component   of   Reflexion   with   more   advanced   structures   such   as   vector   embedding   databases   or
traditional SQL databases.   Specific to code generation, there are many practical limitations to test-
driven development in specifying accurate input-output mappings such as non-deterministic generator
functions, impure functions that interact with APIs, functions that vary output according to hardware
specifications, or functions that invoke parallel or concurrent behavior that may be difficult to predict.
6
Broader impact
Large language models are increasingly used to interact with external environments (e.g. the Internet,
software, robotics, etc.)   and humans.   Our work has the potential of reinforcing and empowering
these agents toward greater automation and work efficiency, but it also amplifies the risks when these
agents were put into misuse.   We believe that this direction of research will need more effort in safety
and ethical considerations.
On   the   other   hand,   reinforcement   learning   has   suffered   from   its   black-box   policy   and   optimiza-
tion setups in which interpretability and alignment have been challenging.   Our proposed “verbal”
reinforcement learning might address some of the issues and turn autonomous agents more inter-
pretable and diagnosable.   For example, in the case of tool-usage that may be too hard for humans to
understand, self-reflections could be monitored to ensure proper intent before using the tool.
7
Conclusion
In this work, we present  Reflexion , an approach that leverages verbal reinforcement to teach agents
to learn from past mistakes.   We empirically show that Reflexion agents significantly outperform
currently   widely-used   decision-making   approaches   by   utilizing   self-reflection.   In   future   work,
Reflexion could be used to employ more advanced techniques that have been thoroughly studied in
traditional RL settings, such as value learning in natural language or off-policy exploration techniques.
8
Reproducibility
We   highly   advise   others   to   use   isolated   execution   environments   when   running   autonomous   code
writing experiments as the generated code is not validated before execution.

Decision-making
Environment:  You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a desk
2, a desk 1, a drawer 6, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a
laundryhamper 1, a safe 1, a shelf 6, a shelf 5, a shelf 4, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, and a shelf 1.
Task:  examine the mug with the desklamp.
Trial #1
>  think:   To solve the task, I need to find and take a mug, then find and use a desklamp.
>  think:   First I need to find a mug.   A mug is more likely to appear in drawer (1-6), desk (1-2), shelf
(1-6), garbagecan (1), laundryhamper (1).   I can check one by one, starting with drawer 1.
>  go to drawer 1
The drawer 1 is closed.
. . .
>  open drawer 6
You open the drawer 6.   The drawer 6 is open.   In it, you see a keychain 2.
>  go to desk 1
On the desk 1, you see a creditcard 3, a desklamp 1, a laptop 2, a mug 1, a pen 1, and a pencil 1.
>  think: Now I find a mug (1). Next, I need to take it.
>  take mug 1 from desk 1
You pick up the mug 1 from the desk 1.
>  think:   Now I take a mug (1).   Next, I need to find a desklamp.   A desklamp is more likely to appear
in desk (1-2), sidetable (1-2), shelf (1-6), bed (1), drawer (1-6).   I can check one by one, starting with
desk 1.
>  go to desk 1
Nothing happens.
>  go to desk 2
On the desk 2, you see a alarmclock 1, a bowl 1, a mug 3, a pencil 3, and a pencil 2.
>  think:   Now I find a desklamp (1).   Next, I need to use it.
>  use desklamp 1
Nothing happens.
>  use desklamp 1
Nothing happens.
Status: Fail
Reflection:  In this environment, my plan was to find a mug then find and use a desklamp. However,
the task says to examine the mug with the desklamp. I should have looked for the desklamp first, then
looked for the mug. I noticed that the desklamp was found on desk 1. In the next trial, I will go to
desk 1, find the lamp, then look for the mug and examine it with the desklamp.
Trial #2
>  go to desk 1
On the desk 1, you see a creditcard 3, a desklamp 1, a laptop 2, a mug 1, a pen 1, and a pencil 1.
>  think: To solve the task, I need to find and take a mug, then find and use a desklamp.
>  take mug 1 from desk 1
You pick up the mug 1 from the desk 1.
>  think:   To solve the task, I need to find and take a mug, then find and use a desklamp.
>  use desklamp 1
You turn on the desklamp 1.

B.1
WebShop Limitation
In 5, we briefly state that Reflexion struggles to overcome local minima choices that require extremely
creative   behavior   to   escape.   We   observe   this   shortcoming   in   an   experiment   on   WebShop   [ 29 ].
WebShop is a web-based problem-solving benchmark that tests agents to navigate an e-commerce
website to locate and purchase products given requests from clients.   We test a two-shot ReAct +
Reflexion agent in 100 environments.   However, after only four trials, we terminate the runs as the
agent does not show signs of improvement 6.   Further, the agent does not generate helpful, intuitive
self-reflections after failed attempts.   We conclude that Reflexion is unable to solve tasks that require
a significant amount of diversity and exploration.   In AlfWorld, the agent is able to adequately explore
new environments because the permissible actions can be seen in the observations.   In HotPotQA,
the agent faces a similar WebShop search query task but is more successful as the search space for
Wikipedia articles is more diverse and requires less precise search queries.   A common problem for
e-commerce search engines is properly handling ambiguity in natural language search interpretations.
Thus, WebShop presents a task that requires very diverse and unique behavior from a Reflexion agent.

Reasoning
D.1
Full example
Trial #1:  Question: Grown-Ups starred the actor
who   was   best   known   for   which   role   on   "’Allo
’Allo!"?
Thought   1:   I   need   to   search   Grown-Ups   and
"’Allo   ’Allo!",   find   the   actor   who   starred   in
Grown-Ups, then find the role he was best known
for in "’Allo ’Allo!".
Action 1:   Search[Grown-Ups]
Observation   1:   Grown-Ups   is   a   1980   British
BBC   television   film   devised   and   directed   by
Mike   Leigh.   It   stars   Lesley   Manville,   Philip
Davis, Brenda Blethyn, Janine Duvitski, Lindsay
Duncan and Sam Kelly.   It was edited by Robin
Sales and produced by Louis Marks for the BBC,
and originally shown on BBC 2 on 28 November
1980.
Thought 2:   Grown-Ups starred Lesley Manville,
Philip Davis, Brenda Blethyn, Janine Duvitski,
Lindsay Duncan and Sam Kelly.   I need to search
"’Allo   ’Allo!"   and   find   which   actor   was   best
known for which role.
Action 2: Search["’Allo ’Allo!"]
Observation 2:   Could not find ["’Allo ’Allo!"].
Similar:   ["’Allo   ’Allo!",   "List   of   ’Allo   ’Allo!
characters", ’Gorden Kaye’, "’Allo ’Allo! (series
2)",   ’Allô,   allô’,   ’Francesca   Gonshaw’,   "’Allo
’Allo!   (series 4)", ’Kim Hartman’, "’Allo ’Allo!
(series 6)", ’Jeremy Lloyd’]
Thought 3: To find the actor who was best known
for   which   role   on   "’Allo   ’Allo!",   I   can   search
Gorden Kaye.
Action 3:   Search[Gorden Kaye]
Observation   3:   Gordon   Irving   Kaye   (7   April
1941   –   23   January   2017),   known   profession-
ally   as   Gorden   Kaye,   was   an   English   actor,
best known for playing womanising café owner
René Artois in the television comedy series ’Allo
’Allo!.
Thought   4:   Gorden   Kaye   was   best   known   for
playing womanising café owner René Artois in
the television comedy series "’Allo ’Allo!".   So
the answer is Rene Artois.
Action 4: Finish[Rene Artois]
Observation 4: Answer is INCORRECT
Trial #2:  Question: Grown-Ups starred the actor
who   was   best   known   for   which   role   on   "’Allo
’Allo!"?
Thought 1:   I need to search the actor who was
best known for a role on "’Allo ’Allo!" and find
out what role they were best known for.
Action 1:   Search[Grown-Ups]
Observation   1:   Grown-Ups   is   a   1980   British
BBC   television   film   devised   and   directed   by
Mike   Leigh.   It   stars   Lesley   Manville,   Philip
Davis, Brenda Blethyn, Janine Duvitski, Lindsay
Duncan and Sam Kelly.   It was edited by Robin
Sales and produced by Louis Marks for the BBC,
and originally shown on BBC 2 on 28 November
1980.
Action 2:   Search[Sam Kelly]
Observation 2:   Roger Michael Kelly (19 Decem-
ber 1943 – 14 June 2014), known by the stage
name Sam Kelly, was an English actor who ap-
peared in film, television, radio and theatre.   He
is best known for his roles as Captain Hans Geer-
ing in ’Allo ’Allo!, Warren in Porridge, Sam in
On the Up, and Ted Liversidge in Barbara.
Thought 3:   Sam Kelly is best known for his role
as   Captain   Hans   Geering   in   "’Allo   ’Allo!",   so
the answer is Captain Hans Geering.
Action 3: Finish[Captain Hans Geering]
Observation 3: Answer is CORRECT
Reflection:  I searched the wrong title for the show, "’Allo ’Allo!", which resulted in no results. I
should have searched the show’s main character, Gorden Kaye, to find the role he was best known for
in the show.

Trial #1:  Question: What profession does John
Lanchester and Alan Dean Foster have in com-
mon?
Thought 1:   Let’s think step by step.   John Lanch-
ester   is   a   novelist,   journalist,   and   critic.   Alan
Dean Foster is a novelist and screenwriter.   So
the profession John Lanchester and Alan Dean
Foster   have   in   common   is   novelist   and   screen-
writer.
Action 1: Finish[novelist and screenwriter]
Observation 1: Answer is INCORRECT
Trial #2:  Question: What profession does John
Lanchester and Alan Dean Foster have in com-
mon?
Thought 1:   Let’s think step by step.   John Lanch-
ester is a novelist, journalist, and financial jour-
nalist.   Alan Dean Foster is a novelist and screen-
writer.   So   the   profession   John   Lanchester   and
Alan Dean Foster have in common is novelist.
Action 1: Finish[novelist]
Observation 1: Answer is CORRECT
Reflection:  My reasoning for the profession John Lanchester and Alan Dean Foster have in common
failed because I incorrectly assumed that they both had the same profession. In the future, when
attempting this question, I should focus on better researching the individual backgrounds of both
authors to ensure that I am accurately identifying their professions. Additionally, I should consider
the possibility that they may have multiple professions in common.

Craig has been a member of six bands, including
Emarosa, Dance Gavin Dance, and Slaves.   Pete
Doherty has been a member of seven bands, in-
cluding The Libertines, Babyshambles, and The

search the past and current bands of both musi-
cians to ensure that I am accurately comparing
their   band   memberships.   After   researching,   I
have   found   that   Jonny   Craig   has   been   a   mem-

Gavin Dance, and Slaves.   Pete Doherty has been
a   member   of   seven   bands,   including   The   Lib-

Jonny Craig has been a member of more bands.
Action 2: Finish[Jonny Craig]
Observation 2: Answer is CORRECT
Reflection:  My reasoning for which musician has been a member of more bands failed because I did
not take into account that Jonny Craig has been a member of more bands in the past, even though Pete
Doherty is currently a member of more bands. In the future, when attempting this question, I should
focus on researching the past and current bands of both musicians to ensure that I am accurately
comparing their band memberships.

Medicine]
Observation 1:   Answer is INCORRECT
Trial #2:  Question: The head of the Foreign Re-
lations   Department   of   the   Rastriya   Janashakti
Party holds a degree that can be abbreviated MS,
M.S., or ScM, in what field?
(Previous trajectory)
Thought   1:   The   question   is   asking   what   field
of study the head of the Foreign Relations De-
partment of the Rastriya Janashakti Party holds
a degree in.   From the context,   I know that the
degree is a Master of Science degree, which is
typically   granted   for   studies   in   sciences,   engi-
neering,   and medicine.   However,   the question
is   asking   for   the   field   of   study,   not   the   degree.
Based on the context, I know that Hari Bahadur
Basnet holds a M.Sc.   in Engineering.
Action 1: Finish[Engineering]
Observation 1: Answer is CORRECT
Reflection:  For the first trial, I misunderstood the question. I thought the question was asking for a
category of degrees, rather than a specific degree. I learned from my mistake and in the second trial, I
focused more closely on the question to understand that it was asking for a specific field of study.
