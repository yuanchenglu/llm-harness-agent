Abstract
Long-context modeling is crucial for next-generation language models, yet the high compu-
tational   cost   of   standard   attention   mechanisms   poses   significant   computational   challenges.
Sparse attention offers a promising direction for improving efficiency while maintaining model
capabilities.   We present NSA, a  N atively trainable  S parse  A ttention mechanism that integrates
algorithmic innovations with hardware-aligned optimizations to achieve efficient long-context
modeling.   NSA employs a dynamic hierarchical sparse strategy,   combining coarse-grained
token compression with fine-grained token selection to preserve both global context awareness
and local precision.   Our approach advances sparse attention design with two key innovations:
(1) We achieve substantial speedups through arithmetic intensity-balanced algorithm design,
with implementation optimizations for modern hardware.   (2) We enable end-to-end training,
reducing pretraining computation without sacrificing model performance. As shown in Figure 1,
experiments show the model pretrained with NSA maintains or exceeds Full Attention models
across general benchmarks, long-context tasks, and instruction-based reasoning.   Meanwhile,
NSA achieves substantial speedups over Full Attention on 64k-length sequences across decod-
ing, forward propagation, and backward propagation, validating its efficiency throughout the
model lifecycle.
1.   Introduction
The research community increasingly recognizes long-context modeling as a crucial capability
for next-generation large language models, driven by diverse real-world applications ranging
from in-depth reasoning (DeepSeek-AI, 2025; Zelikman et al., 2022), repository-level code gener-
ation (Zhang et al., 2023a; Zhang et al.)   and multi-turn autonomous agent systems (Park et al.,
2023).   Recent breakthroughs, including OpenAI’s o-series models, DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI,
2025), and Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google et al., 2024), enabling models to process entire codebases,
lengthy documents, maintain coherent multi-turn conversations over thousands of tokens, and
perform complex reasoning across long-range dependencies.   However, the high complexity (Za-
heer et al., 2020) of vanilla Attention (Vaswani et al., 2017) mechanisms emerges as a critical

latency bottleneck as sequence length increases.   Theoretical estimates indicate that attention
computation with softmax architectures accounts for 70–80% of total latency when decoding
64k-length contexts, underscoring the urgent need for more efficient attention mechanisms.
A natural approach to efficient long-context modeling is to take advantage of the inherent
sparsity of softmax attention (Ge et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023), where selectively computing
critical   query-key   pairs   can   significantly   reduce   computational   overhead   while   preserving
performance.   Recent advances demonstrate this potential through diverse strategies:   KV-cache
eviction methods (Li et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023b; Zhou et al., 2024),   blockwise KV-cache
selection methods (Gao et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024; Xiao et al., 2024a), and sampling, clustering
or   hashing-based   selection   methods   (Chen   et   al.,   2024b;   Desai   et   al.,   2024;   Liu   et   al.,   2024).
Despite these promising strategies, existing sparse attention methods often fall short in practical
deployments.   Many approaches fail to achieve speedups comparable to their theoretical gains;
moreover, most methods lack effective training-time support to fully exploit the sparsity patterns
of attention.
To address these limitations, the deployment of effective sparse attention must tackle two
key challenges:   (1)  Hardware-aligned inference speedup :   Converting theoretical computation
reductions into actual speed improvements requires hardware-friendly algorithm design during
both prefilling and decoding stages to mitigate memory access and hardware scheduling bottle-
necks; (2)  Training-aware algorithm design :   Enabling end-to-end computation with trainable
operators to reduce training costs while maintaining model performance.   These requirements
are crucial for real-world applications to achieve fast long-context inference or training.   When
considering both aspects, existing methods still exhibit a noticeable gap.
To achieve more effective and efficient sparse attention, we present NSA, a Natively trainable
Sparse Attention architecture that integrates hierarchical token modeling.   As shown in Figure 2,
NSA reduces per-query computation by organizing keys and values into temporal blocks and
processing them through three attention paths:   compressed coarse-grained tokens, selectively
retained   fine-grained   tokens,   and   sliding   windows   for   local   contextual   information.   Then

through three parallel attention branches:   For a given query,   preceding keys and values are

we   implement   specialized   kernels   to   maximize   its   practical   efficiency.   NSA   introduces   two
core innovations corresponding to the key requirements above:   (1) Hardware-aligned system:
Optimize blockwise sparse attention for Tensor Core utilization and memory access, ensuring
balanced   arithmetic   intensity.   (2)   Training-aware   design:   Enable   stable   end-to-end   training
through efficient algorithms and backward operators.   This optimization enables NSA to support
both efficient deployment and end-to-end training.
We   evaluate   NSA   through   comprehensive   experiments   on   real-world   language   corpora.
Pretraining on a 27B-parameter transformer backbone with 260B tokens, we assess NSA’s per-
formance across general language evaluations, long-context evaluations, and chain-of-thought
reasoning   evaluation.   We   further   compare   the   kernel   speed   on   A100   GPUs   with   optimized
Triton (Tillet et al., 2019) implementations.   Experimental results demonstrate that NSA achieves
comparable or superior performance to full attention baseline, while outperforming existing
sparse attention approaches.   Additionally, NSA delivers substantial speedups across decoding,
forward, and backward stages compared to Full Attention, with the speedup ratio increasing for
longer sequences.   These results validate that our hierarchical sparse attention design effectively
balances model capability and computational efficiency.
2.   Rethinking Sparse Attention Methods
Modern   sparse   attention   methods   have   made   significant   strides   in   reducing   the   theoretical
computational complexity of transformer models.   However, most approaches predominantly
apply sparsity during inference while retaining a pretrained Full Attention backbone, poten-
tially introducing architectural bias that limits their ability to fully exploit sparse attention’s
advantages.   Before introducing our native sparse architecture, we systematically analyze these
limitations through two critical lenses.
2.1.   The Illusion of Efficient Inference
Despite achieving sparsity in attention computation, many methods fail to achieve correspond-
ing reductions in inference latency, primarily due to two challenges:

Phase-Restricted   Sparsity.   Methods   such   as   H2O   (Zhang   et   al.,   2023b)   apply   sparsity
during   autoregressive   decoding   while   requiring   computationally   intensive   pre-processing
(e.g.   attention   map   calculation,   index   building)   during   prefilling.   In   contrast,   approaches
like   MInference   (Jiang   et   al.,   2024)   focus   solely   on   prefilling   sparsity.   These   methods   fail   to
achieve acceleration across all inference stages, as at least one phase remains computational
costs comparable to Full Attention.   The phase specialization reduces the speedup ability of these
methods in prefilling-dominated workloads like book summarization and code completion, or
decoding-dominated workloads like long chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022) reasoning.
Incompatibility with Advanced Attention Architecture.   Some sparse attention methods
fail to adapt to modern decoding efficient architectures like Mulitiple-Query Attention (MQA)
(Shazeer, 2019) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) (Ainslie et al., 2023), which significantly
reduced the memory access bottleneck during decoding by sharing KV across multiple query
heads.   For instance, in approaches like Quest (Tang et al., 2024), each attention head indepen-
dently selects its KV-cache subset.   Although it demonstrates consistent computation sparsity
and memory access sparsity in Multi-Head Attention (MHA) models, it presents a different sce-
nario in models based on architectures like GQA, where the memory access volume of KV-cache
corresponds to the union of selections from all query heads within the same GQA group.   This
architectural characteristic means that while these methods can reduce computation operations,
the required KV-cache memory access remains relatively high.   This limitation forces a critical
choice: while some sparse attention methods reduce computation, their scattered memory access
pattern conflicts with efficient memory access design from advanced architectures.
These limitations arise because many existing sparse attention methods focus on KV-cache
reduction   or   theoretical   computation   reduction,   but   struggle   to   achieve   significant   latency
reduction in advanced frameworks or backends.   This motivates us to develop algorithms that
combine both advanced architectural and hardware-efficient implementation to fully leverage
sparsity for improving model efficiency.
2.2.   The Myth of Trainable Sparsity
Our pursuit of native trainable sparse attention is motivated by two key insights from analyzing
inference-only approaches:   (1)  Performance Degradation :   Applying sparsity post-hoc forces
models to deviate from their pretrained optimization trajectory.   As demonstrated by Chen et al.
(2024b), top 20% attention can only cover 70% of the total attention scores, rendering structures
like retrieval heads in pretrained models vulnerable to pruning during inference.   (2)  Training
Efficiency Demands :   Efficient handling of long-sequence training is crucial for modern LLM
development.   This includes both pretraining on longer documents to enhance model capacity,
and subsequent adaptation phases such as long-context fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.
However, existing sparse attention methods primarily target inference, leaving the computa-
tional   challenges   in   training   largely   unaddressed.   This   limitation   hinders   the   development
of more capable long-context models through efficient training.   Additionally, efforts to adapt
existing sparse attention for training also expose challenges:
Non-Trainable   Components.   Discrete   operations   in   methods   like   ClusterKV   (Liu   et   al.,
2024) (includes k-means clustering) and MagicPIG (Chen et al., 2024b) (includes SimHash-based
selecting) create discontinuities in the computational graph.   These non-trainable components
prevent gradient flow through the token selection process, limiting the model’s ability to learn
optimal sparse patterns.
Inefficient Back-propagation.   Some theoretically trainable sparse attention methods suffer

from   practical   training   inefficiencies.   Token-granular   selection   strategy   used   in   approaches
like HashAttention (Desai et al., 2024) leads to the need to load a large number of individual
tokens from the KV cache during attention computation.   This non-contiguous memory access
prevents   efficient   adaptation   of   fast   attention   techniques   like   FlashAttention,   which   rely   on
contiguous memory access and blockwise computation to achieve high throughput.   As a result,
implementations are forced to fall back to low hardware utilization, significantly degrading
training efficiency.
2.3.   Native Sparsity as an Imperative
These limitations in inference efficiency and training viability motivate our fundamental redesign
of sparse attention mechanisms.   We propose NSA, a natively sparse attention framework that
addresses both computational efficiency and training requirements.   In the following sections,
we detail the algorithmic design and operator implementation of NSA.
3.   Methodology
Our   technical   approach   spans   algorithm   design   and   kernel   optimization.   In   the   following
subsections,   we   first   introduce   the   background   of   our   methodology.   Then   we   present   the
overall framework of NSA, followed by its key algorithmic components.   Finally, we detail our
hardware-optimized kernel design that maximizes practical efficiency.
3.1.   Background
Attention Mechanism  is widely used in language modeling where each query token  q 𝑡 computes
relevance scores against all preceding keys  k : 𝑡 to generate a weighted sum of values  v : 𝑡 .   Formally,
for an input sequence of length  𝑡 , the attention operation is defined as:
o 𝑡 =  Attn   � q 𝑡 ,  k : 𝑡 ,  v : 𝑡
�
(1)
where Attn denotes the attention function:
Attn   � q 𝑡 ,  k : 𝑡 ,  v : 𝑡
� =
𝑡 ∑︁
𝑖 = 1
𝛼 𝑡 , 𝑖 v 𝑖
� 𝑡
𝑗 = 1   𝛼 𝑡 , 𝑗
,
𝛼 𝑡 , 𝑖 =   𝑒
q ⊤
𝑡 k 𝑖
√
𝑑𝑘 .
(2)
Here,  𝛼 𝑡 , 𝑖 represents the attention weight between  q 𝑡 and  k 𝑖 , and  𝑑 𝑘 is the feature dimension of
keys.   As sequence length increases, attention computation becomes increasingly dominant in
the overall computational cost, presenting significant challenges for long-context processing.
Arithmetic Intensity  is the ratio of compute operations to memory accesses.   It intrinsically
shapes   algorithm   optimization   on   hardware.   Each   GPU   has   a   critical   arithmetic   intensity
determined   by   its   peak   compute   capability   and   memory   bandwidth,   calculated   as   the   ratio
of these two hardware limits.   For computation tasks,   arithmetic intensity above this critical
threshold becomes compute-bound (limited by GPU FLOPS), while below it becomes memory-
bound (limited by memory bandwidth).
Specifically   for   causal   self-attention   mechanism,   during   training   and   prefilling   phases,
batched matrix multiplications and attention computations exhibit high arithmetic intensity,
making these stages compute-bound on modern accelerators.   In contrast, auto-regressive de-
coding becomes memory-bandwidth constrained because it generates one token per forward
pass while requiring loading the entire key-value cache, resulting in low arithmetic intensity.

This leads to different optimization goals — reducing computation cost during training and
prefilling, while reducing memory access during decoding.
3.2.   Overall Framework
To   leverage   the   potential   of   attention   with   natural   sparse   pattern,   we   propose   replacing   the
original key-value pairs  k : 𝑡 ,  v : 𝑡 in Equation (1) with a more compact and information-dense set
of representation key-value pairs   ˜ 𝐾 𝑡 ,   ˜ 𝑉 𝑡 given each query  q 𝑡 .   Specifically, we formally define the
optimized attention output as follows:
˜ 𝐾 𝑡 =   𝑓 𝐾 ( q 𝑡 ,  k : 𝑡 ,  v : 𝑡 ) ,
˜ 𝑉 𝑡 =   𝑓 𝑉 ( q 𝑡 ,  k : 𝑡 ,  v : 𝑡 )
(3)
o ∗
𝑡 =  Attn  � q 𝑡 ,   ˜ 𝐾 𝑡 ,   ˜ 𝑉 𝑡
�
(4)
where   ˜ 𝐾 𝑡 ,   ˜ 𝑉 𝑡 are dynamically constructed based on the current query  q 𝑡 and the contextual
memory  k : 𝑡 ,  v : 𝑡 .   We can design various mapping strategies to get different categories of   ˜ 𝐾 𝑐
𝑡 ,   ˜ 𝑉 𝑐
𝑡 ,
and combine them as follows:
o ∗
𝑡 =
∑︁
𝑐 ∈C
𝑔 𝑐
𝑡 ·  Attn ( q 𝑡 ,   ˜ 𝐾 𝑐
𝑡 ,   ˜ 𝑉 𝑐
𝑡 ) .
(5)
As illustrated in Figure 2, NSA have three mapping strategies  C   =   { cmp ,  slc ,  win } , representing
compression, selection, and sliding window for keys and values.   𝑔 𝑐
𝑡 ∈[ 0, 1 ]   is the gate score for
corresponding strategy  𝑐 , derived from input features via an MLP and sigmoid activation.   Let
𝑁 𝑡 denote the total number of remapped keys/values:
𝑁 𝑡 =
∑︁
𝑐 ∈C
size [   ˜ 𝐾 𝑐
𝑡 ] .
(6)
We maintain a high sparsity ratio by ensuring 𝑁 𝑡 ≪ 𝑡 .
3.3.   Algorithm Design
In   this   subsection,   we   introduce   the   design   of   our   remapping   strategies   𝑓 𝐾 and   𝑓 𝑉 :   token
compression, token selection, and sliding window.
3.3.1.   Token Compression
By aggregating sequential blocks of keys or values into block-level representations, we obtain
compressed   keys   and   values   that   capture   the   information   of   the   entire   block.   Formally,   the
compressed key representation is defined as:
˜ 𝐾 cmp
𝑡
=   𝑓 cmp
𝐾
( k : 𝑡 )   =
�
𝜑 ( k 𝑖𝑑 + 1: 𝑖𝑑 + 𝑙 )
���� 0   ⩽ 𝑖 ⩽
� 𝑡 − 𝑙
𝑑
��
(7)
where  𝑙 is the block length,  𝑑 is the sliding stride between adjacent blocks, and   𝜑 is a learnable
MLP   with   intra-block   position   encoding   to   map   keys   in   a   block   to   a   single   compressed   key.
˜ 𝐾 cmp
𝑡
∈ R 𝑑 𝑘 × ⌊ 𝑡 − 𝑙
𝑑 ⌋ is tensor composed by compresion keys.   Usually, we adopt  𝑑<   𝑙 to mitigate
information   fragmentation.   An   analogous   formulation   holds   for   the   compressed   value   rep-
resentation   ˜ 𝑉 cmp
𝑡
.   Compressed representations capture coarser-grained higher-level semantic
information and reduce computational burden of attention.

3.3.2.   Token Selection
Using only compressed keys, values might lose important fine-grained information, motivating
us to selectively preserve individual keys, values.   Below we describe our efficient token selection
mechanism   that   identifies   and   preserves   the   most   relevant   tokens   with   low   computational
overhead.
Blockwise Selection.   Our selection strategy processes key and value sequences in spacial
continuous blocks, motivated by two key factors:   hardware efficiency considerations and inher-
ent distribution patterns of attention scores.   Blockwise selection is crucial to achieve efficient
computation on modern GPUs.   That is because modern GPU architectures exhibit significantly
higher throughput for continuous block accesses compared to random index-based reads.   Also,
blockwise computation enables optimal utilization of Tensor Cores.   This architectural character-
istic has established blockwise memory access and computation as a fundamental principle in
high-performance attention implementations, as exemplified by FlashAttention’s block-based
design.   Blockwise   selection   follows   the   inherent   distribution   patterns   of   attention   scores.
Prior works (Jiang et al., 2024) have shown that attention scores often exhibit spatial continuity,
suggesting that neighboring keys tend to share similar importance levels.   Our visualization in
Section 6.2 also shows this spatial continuous pattern.
To implement blockwise selection, we first divide key, value sequences into selection blocks.
To identify the most important blocks for attention computation, we need to assign importance
scores to each block.   Below we present our method for computing these block-level importance
scores.
Importance   Score   Computation.   Computing   block   importance   scores   could   introduce
significant overhead.   Fortunately, the attention computation of compression tokens produces
intermediate attention scores that we can leverage to induce selection block importance scores,
formulated as:
p cmp
𝑡
=  Softmax
�
q 𝑇
𝑡 ˜ 𝐾 cmp
𝑡
�
,
(8)
where   p cmp
𝑡
∈ R ⌊ 𝑡 − 𝑙
𝑑 ⌋ + 1   is   the   attention   scores   between   𝑞 𝑡 and   compression   keys   ˜ 𝐾 cmp
𝑡
.   Let   𝑙 ′
denote the selection block size.   When compression blocks and selection blocks share the same
blocking scheme, i.e.,  𝑙 ′   =   𝑙 =   𝑑 , we can directly obtain the selection block importance scores  p slc
𝑡
by  p slc
𝑡
=   p cmp
𝑡
straightforwardly.   For cases where the blocking schemes differ, we derive the
importance scores for selection blocks according to their spatial relationship.   Given  𝑙 ⩽ 𝑙 ′ ,  𝑑 |   𝑙
and  𝑑 |   𝑙 ′ , we have:
p slc
𝑡 [  𝑗 ]   =
𝑙 ′
𝑑 − 1
∑︁
𝑚 = 0
𝑙
𝑑 − 1
∑︁
𝑛 = 0
p cmp
𝑡
� 𝑙 ′
𝑑 𝑗 − 𝑚 − 𝑛
�
,
(9)
where [·]   denotes the indexing operator for accessing vector element.   For models employing
GQA or MQA where key-value caches are shared across query heads, consistent block selection
across these heads has to be ensured to minimize KV cache loading during decoding.   The shared
importance scores across heads in a group are formally defined as:
p slc
𝑡
′   =
𝐻
∑︁
ℎ = 1
p slc, ( ℎ )
𝑡
,
(10)
where  ( ℎ )  in the superscript denotes the head index, and   𝐻 is the number of query heads in each
group.   This aggregation ensures consistent block selection across heads within the same group.

Top- 𝑛 Block   Selection.   After   obtaining   the   selection   block   importance   scores,   We   retain
tokens within the top- 𝑛 sparse blocks ranked by block importance scores, formulated as:
I 𝑡 =   { 𝑖 |   rank ( p slc
𝑡
′ [ 𝑖 ])   ⩽ 𝑛 }
(11)
˜ 𝐾 slc
𝑡
=  Cat
�
{ k 𝑖𝑙 ′ + 1: ( 𝑖 + 1 ) 𝑙 ′ | 𝑖 ∈I 𝑡 }
�
,
(12)
where rank (·)  denotes the ranking position in descending order, with rank = 1 corresponding
to   the   highest   score,   I 𝑡 is   the   set   of   selected   blocks’   indices,   Cat   denotes   the   concatenation
operation.   ˜ 𝐾 slc
𝑡
∈ R 𝑑 𝑘 × 𝑛𝑙 ′   is tensor composed by compresion keys.   An analogous formulation
applies   to   the   fine-grained   value   ˜ 𝑉 slc
𝑡 .   The   selected   keys   and   values   then   participate   in   the
attention computation with  q 𝑡 as defined in Equation (5).
3.3.3.   Sliding Window
In attention mechanisms, local patterns typically adapt faster and can dominate the learning
process,   potentially   preventing   the   model   from   effectively   learning   from   compression   and
selection tokens.   To address this issue, we introduce a dedicated sliding window branch that
explicitly handles local context, allowing other branches (compression and selection) to focus
on learning their respective features without being shortcutted by local patterns.   Specifically,
we   maintain   recent   tokens   ˜ 𝐾 win
𝑡
=   k 𝑡 − 𝑤 : 𝑡 ,   ˜ 𝑉 win
𝑡
=   v 𝑡 − 𝑤 : 𝑡 in   a   window   𝑤 ,   and   isolate   attention
computations of different information sources (compression tokens, and selected tokens, sliding
window) into separate branches.   These branch outputs are then aggregated through a learned
gating mechanism.   To further prevent shortcut learning across attention branches with marginal
computational overhead,   we provide independent keys and values for three branches.   This
architectural design enables stable learning by preventing gradient interference between local
and long-range pattern recognition, while introducing minimal overhead.
After obtaining all three categories of keys and values (   ˜ 𝐾 cmp
𝑡
,   ˜ 𝑉 cmp
𝑡
;   ˜ 𝐾 slc
𝑡 ,   ˜ 𝑉 slc
𝑡 ; and   ˜ 𝐾 win
𝑡
,   ˜ 𝑉 win
𝑡
),
we compute the final attention output following Equation (5).   Together with the compression,
selection, and sliding window mechanisms described above, this forms the complete algorithmic
framework of NSA.
3.4.   Kernel Design
To   achieve   FlashAttention-level   speedup   during   the   training   and   prefilling,   we   implement
hardware-aligned sparse attention kernels upon Triton.   Given MHA is memory-intensive and
inefficient for decoding, we focus on architectures with shared KV caches like GQA and MQA
following the current state-of-the-art LLMs.   While compression and sliding window attention
computations are readily compatible with existing FlashAttention-2 kernels, we introduce the
specialized kernel design for sparse selection attention.   If we were to follow FlashAttention’s
strategy of loading temporally continuous query blocks into SRAM, it would result in inefficient
memory access since queries within a block may require disjoint KV blocks.   To address this,
our   key   optimization   lies   in   a   different   query   grouping   strategy:   for   each   position   on   the
query sequence, we load all query heads within a GQA group (they share the same sparse KV
blocks) into SRAM. Figure 3 illustrates our forward pass implementation.   The proposed kernel
architecture is characterized by the following key features:
1.   Group-Centric Data Loading .   For each inner loop, load all heads’ queries  𝑄 ∈ R [ ℎ , 𝑑 𝑘 ]   in
the group at position  𝑡 and their shared sparse key/value block indices  I 𝑡 .

2.   Shared KV Fetching .   In the inner loop, Sequentially load continuous key/value blocks
indexed by  I 𝑡 into SRAM as   𝐾 ∈ R [ 𝐵 𝑘 , 𝑑 𝑘 ] , 𝑉 ∈ R [ 𝐵 𝑘 , 𝑑 𝑣 ]   to minimize memory loading, where
𝐵 𝑘 is the kernel block size satisfying   𝐵 𝑘 | 𝑙 ′ .
3.   Outer   Loop   on   Grid .   Since   the   inner-loop   length   (proportional   to   the   selected   block
count  𝑛 ) remains nearly identical for different query blocks, we put query/output loops in
Triton’s grid scheduler to simplify and optimize the kernel.
This design achieves near-optimal arithmetic intensity by (1) eliminating redundant KV trans-
fers through group-wise sharing, and (2) balancing compute workloads across GPU streaming
multiprocessors.

4.   Experiments
We evaluate NSA through three lenses:   (1) general benchmarks performance, (2) long-context
benchmarks performance, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning performance, comparing against
Full Attention baseline and state-of-the-art sparse attention methods.   We defer the efficiency
analysis of our sparse computation paradigm to Section 5, where we provide detailed discussions
on training and inference speed.
4.1.   Pretraining Setup
Following the common practice in state-of-the-art LLMs, our experiments adopt a backbone
combining Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), featuring 27 B  total
parameters with 3 B  active parameters.   The model consists of 30 layers with a hidden dimension
of 2560.   For GQA, we set the number of groups to 4, with a total of 64 attention heads.   For each
head, the hidden dimensions of the query, key, and value are configured as  𝑑 𝑞 =   𝑑 𝑘 =  192 and
𝑑 𝑣 =   128, respectively.   For MoE, we utilize the DeepSeekMoE (Dai et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI,
2024) structure, with 72 routed experts and 2 shared experts, and set the top-k experts to 6.   To
ensure training stability, the MoE in the first layer is replaced by an MLP in the form of SwiGLU.

Table   1   |   Pretraining   performance   comparison   between   the   full   attention   baseline   and   NSA
on general benchmarks, across knowledge (MMLU, MMLU-PRO, CMMLU), reasoning (BBH,
GSM8K, MATH, DROP), and coding (MBPP, HumanEval) tasks.   NSA achieves superior average
performance on most benchmarks despite high sparsity.
The proposed architecture achieves an effective trade-off between computation cost and model
performance.   For NSA, we set compression block size   𝑙 =   32,   sliding stride   𝑑 =   16,   selected
block size  𝑙 ′   =  64, selected block count  𝑛 =  16 (including fixed activating the 1 initial block and
2   local   blocks),   and   sliding   window   size   𝑤 =   512.   Both   Full   Attention   and   sparse   attention
models are pretrained on 270 B  tokens of 8 k -length texts, followed by continued training and
supervised fine-tuning on 32 k -length texts with YaRN (Peng et al., 2024) to achieve long-context
adaptation.   Both models are trained to full convergence to ensure fair comparison.   As shown in
Figure 4, the pretraining loss curve of our NSA and Full Attention baseline demonstrates stable
and smooth decline, with NSA consistently outperforming the Full Attention model.
4.2.   Baselines Methods
In addition to comparing with Full Attention,   we evaluate several state-of-the-art inference-
stage sparse attention methods:   H2O (Zhang et al., 2023b), infLLM (Xiao et al., 2024a), Quest
(Tang et al., 2024), and Exact-Top, which first computes full attention score and select the top- 𝑛

methods span diverse sparse attention paradigms, including KV-cache eviction, query-aware
selection, and exact top- 𝑛 sparse selection.
For general evaluation, where most samples have lengths within the local context window of
sparse attention baselines, these methods are effectively equivalent to Full Attention.   Therefore,
we present only the comparison results between NSA and Full Attention baseline in this setting.
In the long-context evaluation, we conduct comparisons across all baseline methods, with the
sparsity of all sparse attention methods set to the same to ensure a fair comparison.   For chain-
of-thought reasoning evaluation, which requires long-text supervised fine-tuning, we limit our
comparison to Full Attention, as sparse attention baselines do not support training.
4.3.   Performance Comparison
General   Evaluation.   We   evaluated   the   pretrained   NSA   and   Full   Attention   baseline,   on   a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks spanning knowledge, reasoning, and coding capabilities,
including MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-PRO (Wang et al., 2024), CMMLU (Li et al.,
2023), BBH (Suzgun et al., 2022), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2020),
DROP (Dua et al., 2019), MBPP (Austin et al., 2021), and HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021).   The
results are shown in Table 1.   Despite its sparsity, NSA achieves superior overall performance,
outperforming   all   baselines   including   Full   Attention   on   7   out   of   9   metrics.   This   indicates
that although NSA may not fully leverage its efficiency advantages on shorter sequences,   it
shows strong performance.   Notably, NSA demonstrates significant gains in reasoning-related
benchmarks   (DROP:   +0.042,   GSM8K:   +0.034),   suggesting   that   our   pretraining   helps   models
to   develop   specialized   attention   mechanisms.   This   sparse   attention   pretraining   mechanism
forces model to focus on the most important information, potentially enhancing performance
by filtering out noise from irrelevant attention pathways.   The consistent performance across
diverse evaluations also validates NSA’s robustness as a general-purpose architecture.
Long-Context Evaluation.   As shown in Figure 5, NSA achieves perfect retrieval accuracy
across all positions in 64k-context needle-in-a-haystack (Kamradt, 2023) test.   This performance
stems from our hierarchical sparse attention design, which combines compression tokens for
efficient global context scanning, and selection tokens for precise local information retrieval.   The
coarse-grained compression identifies relevant context blocks at low computational cost, while
the   token-level   attention   on   selected   tokens   ensures   the   preservation   of   critical   fine-grained
information.   This design enables NSA to maintain both global awareness and local precision.
We also evaluate NSA on LongBench (Bai et al., 2023) against state-of-the-art sparse attention

methods and Full Attention baseline.   To ensure consistent sparsity, we set the token activated
by each query in all sparse attention baselines to 2560 tokens, which corresponds to the average
number of tokens activated in NSA when handling 32k sequence lengths.   Following Stream-
LLM (Xiao et al., 2023), this token budget includes the leading 128 tokens and 512 local tokens.
We exclude certain subsets from LongBench due to their low scores across all models, which
may   not   provide   meaningful   comparisons.   As   shown   in   Table   2,   NSA   achieves   the   highest
average score 0.469, outperforming all baselines (+0.032 over Full Attention and +0.046 over
Exact-Top).   This improvement arises from two key innovations:   (1) our native sparse attention
design, which enables end-to-end optimization of sparse patterns during pretraining, facilitates
synchronized adaptation between the sparse attention module and other model components;
and (2) the hierarchical sparse attention mechanism achieves a balance between local and global
information processing.
Notably, NSA demonstrates exceptional performance on tasks requiring complex reasoning
over long contexts, achieving +0.087 and +0.051 improvements over Full Attention on multi-hop
QA tasks (HPQ and 2Wiki), exceeding the performance of baselines on code understanding
(LCC: +0.069), and outperforming other methods on passage retrieval (PassR-en:   +0.075).   These
results validate NSA’s capability to handle diverse long-context challenges, with its natively
pretrained sparse attention providing additional benefits in learning task-optimal patterns.
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Evaluation.   To evaluate NSA’s compatibility with advanced
downstream training paradigms, we investigate its capacity to acquire chain-of-thought mathe-
matical reasoning abilities via post-training.   Given the limited effectiveness of reinforcement
learning on smaller-scale models, we employ knowledge distillation from DeepSeek-R1, con-
ducting supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with 10B tokens of 32k-length mathematical reasoning
traces.   This produces two comparable models:   Full Attention-R (Full Attention baseline) and
NSA-R (our sparse variant).   We assess both models on the challenging American Invitational
Mathematics Examination (AIME 24) benchmark.   We use a sampling temperature of 0.7 and a
top- 𝑝 value of 0.95 to generate 16 responses for each question and obtain the average score.   To
validate the impact of reasoning depth, we conduct experiments with two generation context
limits:   8k and 16k tokens,   measuring whether extended reasoning chains improve accuracy.
Example comparisons of model predictions are provided in Appendix A.

Our implementation significantly reduces latency across all context lengths, with the improve-
ment becoming more pronounced as input length increases.
As shown in Table 3, NSA-R achieves significantly higher accuracy than Full Attention-R
under the 8k context setting (+0.075), with this advantage persisting at 16k contexts (+0.054).
These   results   validate   two   key   benefits   of   native   sparse   attention:   (1)   The   pretrained   sparse
attention patterns enable efficient capture of long-range logical dependencies critical for complex
mathematical derivations; (2) Our architecture’s hardware-aligned design maintains sufficient
context density to support growing reasoning depth without catastrophic forgetting.   The consis-
tent outperformance across context lengths confirms sparse attention’s viability for advanced
reasoning tasks when natively integrated into the training pipeline.
5.   Efficiency Analysis
We   evaluate   the   computational   efficiency   of   NSA   against   Full   Attention   on   an   8-GPU   A100
system.   In efficiency analysis, we also configure the model with GQA group  𝑔 =  4, heads per
group  ℎ =  16, query/key dimension  𝑑 𝑘 =  192, and value dimension  𝑑 𝑣 =  128.   Following the same
settings in Section 4, we set NSA compression block size  𝑙 =  32, sliding stride  𝑑 =  16, selected
block size  𝑙 ′   =  64, selected block count  𝑛 =  16, and sliding window size  𝑤 =  512.
5.1.   Training Speed
We compare the Triton-based implementations of our NSA attention and Full Attention with
Triton-based FlashAttention-2 to ensure fair speed comparison across the same backend.   As
shown in Figure 6, our NSA achieves progressively greater speedups as context length increases,
up   to   9.0 ×   forward   and   6.0 ×   backward   speedup   at   64k   context-length.   Notably,   the   speed
advantage becomes more pronounced with longer sequences.   This speedup stems from our

hardware-aligned algorithm design to maximize the efficiency of sparse attention architecture:
(1) The Blockwise memory access pattern maximizes Tensor Core utilization through coalesced
loads, (2) The delicate loop scheduling in the kernel eliminates redundant KV transfers.
5.2.   Decoding Speed
The   decoding speed   of Attention   is primarily   determined by   the   memory   access   bottleneck,
which is closely tied to the amount of KV cache loading.   In each decoding step, Our NSA just
needs   to   load   at   most

cant reduction in latency as the decoding length increases, achieving up to 11.6 ×  speedup at
64k   context-length.   This   advantage   in   memory   access   efficiency   also   amplifies   with   longer
sequences.
6.   Discussion
In this section, we reflect on the development process of NSA and discuss key insights gained
from our exploration of different sparse attention strategies.   While our approach demonstrates
promising results, understanding the challenges encountered with alternative strategies and
analyzing attention patterns provides valuable context for future research directions.   We first
examine challenges with alternative token selection strategies that motivated our design choices,
followed by visualizations that offer insights into attention distribution patterns.
6.1.   Challenges with Alternative Token Selection Strategies
Before designing NSA, we explored adapting existing sparse attention methods to the training
stage.   However,   these   attempts   encountered   various   challenges,   prompting   us   to   design   a
different sparse attention architecture:
Key-Clustering   Based   Strategies.
We   examined   clustering-based   strategies   like   Clus-
terKV (Liu et al., 2024). These methods store Keys and Values from the same cluster in contiguous
memory regions.   While theoretically feasible for training and inference, they face three signif-
icant   challenges:   (1)   Non-trivial   computational   overhead   introduced   by   dynamic   clustering
mechanisms;   (2)   Operator   optimization   difficulties   exacerbated   by   inter-cluster   imbalances,
especially in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) systems, where skewed Expert Parallelism (EP) group
execution times lead to persistent load imbalances; (3) Implementation constraints arising from
the need for mandatory periodic reclustering and chunk-sequential training protocols.   These
combined   factors   create   substantial   bottlenecks,   significantly   limiting   their   effectiveness   for
real-world deployment.

Other Blockwise Selection Strategies.   We also considered blockwise key, value selection
strategies different from NSA, such as Quest (Tang et al., 2024) and InfLLM (Xiao et al., 2024a).
These methods rely on computing an importance score for each KV block and selecting the top- 𝑛
blocks   based   on   their   similarity   with   𝑞 𝑡 .   However,   existing   methods   face   two   critical   issues:
(1) Since the selection operation is non-differentiable, importance score computation based on
neural networks relies on auxiliary loss, which increases operator overhead and often degrades
model performance; (2) Heuristic parameter-free importance score computation strategy suffer
from low recall rates, leading to suboptimal performance.   We evaluate both approaches on a
3B-parameter model with similar architecture and compare their loss curve with NSA and Full
Attention.   For the auxiliary loss-based selection method, we introduce additional queries for
each token and representative keys for each block to estimate the block importance scores.   We
compute block-level supervision signals by mean-pooling attention scores within each key block,
and use KL divergence to supervise block importance prediction.   We maintain individual query
granularity instead of block-averaged queries to accommodate efficient decoding.   This auxiliary
loss-based importance estimation shares conceptual similarity with SeerAttention (Gao et al.,
2024).   For the heuristic parameter-free selection method, following the strategy of Quest, we
implement direct selection using the product between queries and coordinate-wise min-max of
the key chunks, without introducing additional parameters.   We also explore a cold-start training
approach where Full Attention is applied for the initial 1000 steps before transitioning to the
heuristic blockwise selection.   As shown in   Figure 7, both methods exhibited inferior loss.
6.2.   Visualization
To   explore   potential   patterns   in   transformer   attention   distributions   and   seek   inspiration   for
our design, we visualize the attention map from our pretrained 27B Full Attention model in
Figure 8.   The visualization reveals interesting patterns where attention scores tend to exhibit
blockwise clustering characteristics, with nearby keys often showing similar attention scores.
This observation inspired our design of NSA, suggesting that selecting key blocks based on
spatial   continuity   might   be   a   promising   approach.   The   blockwise   clustering   phenomenon
indicates that tokens adjacent in the sequence may share certain semantic relationships with
query tokens, though the exact nature of these relationships requires further investigation.   This
15

<!-- Page 16 -->

observation motivated us to explore a sparse attention mechanism that operates on continuous
token blocks rather than individual tokens, aiming to enhance computational efficiency and
preserve high-attention patterns.
7.   Related Works
We review existing approaches that improve the efficiency of attention computation through
sparse attention.   These methods can be broadly categorized into three groups based on their core
strategies:   (1) fixed sparse pattern, (2) dynamic token pruning, and (3) query-aware selection.
We introduce several representative works from each category.
7.1.   Fixed Sparse Pattern
SlidingWindow is a commonly used approach that allows the query to compute attention only
within a fixed window.   StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) combines attention sinks with local
windows to process continuous text streams.   MoA (Fu et al., 2024a) and DuoAttention (Xiao
et al., 2024b) also adopt similar local and sink information for long sequence modeling.   Long-
former (Beltagy et al., 2020) interleaves local windowed attention with global tokens to process
long sequences.   Compared with them, our NSA does not rely on pre-defined sparse patterns,
but learns the patterns automatically, unlocking the potential to utilize full context.
7.2.   Dynamic Token Pruning
Some methods are designed to reduce memory and computation costs during inference through
dynamic   KV-cache   pruning.   H2O   (Zhang   et   al.,   2023b),   BUZZ   (Zhao   et   al.,   2024),   and   Se-
pLLM (Chen et al., 2024a) implement adaptive approaches to reduce KV-cache memory usage
during decoding.   These methods dynamically evict tokens deemed less important for future
predictions.   FastGen Ge et al. (2023) and HeadKV (Fu et al., 2024b) optimize computation by
assigning different strategies to individual attention heads.   SnapKV (Li et al., 2024) introduces a
token pruning strategy that reduces the KV-cache by selectively retaining only the most crucial
features, enabling efficient memory usage.   Unlike these inference-focused approaches, our NSA
incorporates sparsity natively during the training phase.
7.3.   Query-Aware Selection
Other works focus on query-dependent token selection methods to reduce attention computation
while   preserving   attention   quality.   Quest   (Tang   et   al.,   2024)   employs   a   blockwise   selection
strategy where each chunk’s importance is estimated by product between query and coordinate-
wise   min-max   of   the   key   chunks.   InfLLM   (Xiao   et   al.,   2024a)   combines   fixed   patterns   with
retrieval by maintaining attention sinks,   local context,   and retrievable chunks.   This method
selects representative keys from each chunk to estimate chunk importance. HashAttention (Desai
et al., 2024) formulates pivotal token identification as a recommendation problem by mapping
queries   and   keys   to   Hamming   space   using   learned   functions.   ClusterKV   (Liu   et   al.,   2024)
achieves   sparsity   by   firstly   clustering   keys   and   then   selecting   the   most   relevant   clusters   for
attention computation based on query-cluster similarity.   MInference (Jiang et al., 2024) and
TokenSelect (Wu et al., 2024) select KV pairs for computation based on token-level importance
scoring.   SeerAttention   (Gao   et   al.,   2024)   separates   queries   and   keys   into   spatial   blocks   and
performs blockwise selection for efficient computation.   Compared to these methods, our NSA

achieves hardware-aligned sparse attention computation throughout the full model lifecycle,
including training, prefilling, and decoding.
8.   Conclusion
We   present   NSA,   a   hardware-aligned   sparse   attention   architecture   for   efficient   long-context
modeling.   By integrating hierarchical token compression with blockwise token selection within
a   trainable   architecture,   our   architecture   achieves   accelerated   training   and   inference   while
maintaining Full Attention performance.   NSA advances the state-of-the-art by demonstrating
general benchmark performance matches full-attention baselines, exceeding modeling capability
in long-context evaluations, and enhanced reasoning ability, all accompanied by measurable
reductions in computational latency and achieving significant speedup.

𝑦
𝑥𝑧 =  2 1 / 3  3.
𝑧
𝑥𝑦 =  2 1 / 4
Expressing each variable in terms of   𝑥 ,   𝑦 , and   𝑧 :
1.   𝑥 =
√
2  ·   𝑦𝑧 2.   𝑦 =  2 1 / 3   ·  𝑥𝑧 3.   𝑧 =  2 1 / 4   ·  𝑥𝑦
Substituting these expressions into each other, we find:
-   From   𝑥 =
√
2  ·   𝑦𝑧 and   𝑦 =   2 1 / 3   ·  𝑥𝑧 ,   we   get   𝑥 =
√
2  · ( 2 1 / 3   ·  𝑥𝑧 ) ·  𝑧 ,   leading   to
𝑧 =  2 − 5 / 12 . - Substituting  𝑧 into the equation for   𝑦 , we get   𝑦 =  2 − 3 / 8 . - Substituting
𝑧 and   𝑦 into the equation for   𝑥 , we get   𝑥 =  2 − 7 / 24 .
Next, we compute   𝑥 4 𝑦 3 𝑧 2 :
-   𝑥 4   =   ( 2 − 7 / 24 ) 4   =  2 − 7 / 6   -   𝑦 3   =   ( 2 − 3 / 8 ) 3   =  2 − 9 / 8   -   𝑧 2   =   ( 2 − 5 / 12 ) 2   =  2 − 5 / 6
Multiplying these together:
𝑥 4 𝑦 3 𝑧 2   =  2 − 7 / 6   ·  2 − 9 / 8   ·  2 − 5 / 6   =  2 − 75 / 24   =  2 − 25 / 8
Taking the logarithm base 2:
log 2 ( 𝑥 4 𝑦 3 𝑧 2 )   =  − 25 / 8
The absolute value is:
|  log 2 ( 𝑥 4 𝑦 3 𝑧 2 )|   =  25 / 8

Thus,  𝑚 =  25 and  𝑛 =  8, giving  𝑚 +  𝑛 =  33.

However, upon verifying the third equation, we realize the system might not
have a solution.   Therefore, we use matrix inversion to solve the system:


log 2 ( 𝑥 ) − log 2 ( 𝑦 ) − log 2 ( 𝑧 )   =   1

log 2 ( 𝑦 ) − log 2 ( 𝑥 ) − log 2 ( 𝑧 )   =   1

We solve this system using Cramer’s rule and matrix inversion. The determinant
of the matrix is -2, and the solutions are:
𝐴 =   61
48 ,
𝐵 =   13
16 ,
𝐶 =  − 1

Thus, we have:
𝑥 =  2 61 / 48 ,
𝑦 =  2 13 / 16 ,
𝑧 =  2 − 1 / 6
We need to find
�� log 2 ( 𝑥 4 𝑦 3 𝑧 2 )

Converting to a common denominator (48):
4  ·   61

Summing these:
244
48   +   117

48   =   115

The fraction   115
16   is in simplest form, so  𝑚 =  115 and  𝑛 =  16.   Therefore,   𝑚 +  𝑛 =

1.   log 𝑥 ( 𝑦 𝑥 )   =  10
2.   log 𝑦 ( 𝑥 4 𝑦 )   =  10
We start by applying the logarithm power rule to both equations.
For the first equation:
log 𝑥 ( 𝑦 𝑥 )   =   𝑥 ·  log 𝑥 ( 𝑦 )   =  10
Let   𝑧 =  log 𝑦 ( 𝑥 ) .   Then, log 𝑥 ( 𝑦 )   =   1
𝑧 .   Substituting this into the equation, we get:
𝑥 ·   1
𝑧 =  10   = ⇒ 𝑥 =  10 𝑧
For the second equation:
log 𝑦 ( 𝑥 4 𝑦 )   =   𝑦 ·  log 𝑦 ( 𝑥 4 )   =  10
Using the power rule, we get:
𝑦 ·  4 log 𝑦 ( 𝑥 )   =  10   = ⇒ 4 𝑦 log 𝑦 ( 𝑥 )   =  10
Since log 𝑦 ( 𝑥 )   =   𝑧 , this simplifies to:
4 𝑦𝑧 =  10   = ⇒ 𝑦𝑧 =   5
2
We now have two expressions:
1.   𝑥 =  10 𝑧
2.   𝑦 =   5 / 2
𝑧
Substituting   𝑥 =  10 𝑧 and   𝑦 =   5 / 2
𝑧 into the product   𝑥𝑦 , we get:
𝑥𝑦 =   ( 10 𝑧 ) ·
� 5 / 2
𝑧
�
=  10 𝑧 ·   5
2 𝑧 =  10  ·   5
2   =  25

Given the problem where real numbers   𝑥 and   𝑦 with   𝑥 ,  𝑦>   1 satisfy the equa-
tions log 𝑥 ( 𝑦 𝑥 )   =  10 and log 𝑦 ( 𝑥 4 𝑦 )   =  10, we need to find the value of   𝑥𝑦 .
First, we convert the logarithmic equations to their exponential forms using the
change of base formula.

1.   log 𝑥 ( 𝑦 𝑥 )   =  10
𝑥 log 𝑥 ( 𝑦 )   =  10
Using   the   change   of   base   formula,   log 𝑥 ( 𝑦 )   =   ln  𝑦
ln  𝑥 .   Since   log 𝑦 𝑥 =   9
4 ,   we   have
log 𝑥 𝑦 =   4
9 .   Thus,
𝑥 ·   4
9   =  10   = ⇒ 𝑥 =   10  ·  9
4
=   90
4   =   45
2
2.   log 𝑦 ( 𝑥 4 𝑦 )   =  10
4 log 𝑦 𝑥 +  1  =  10   = ⇒ 4 log 𝑦 𝑥 =  9   = ⇒ log 𝑦 𝑥 =   9
4
Again, using the change of base formula, log 𝑥 𝑦 =   4
9 .
Next, we express   𝑥 and   𝑦 in terms of each other:
𝑥 =   45
2
and
𝑦 =
� 45
2
� 4 / 9
We then compute the product   𝑥𝑦 :
𝑥𝑦 =
� 45
2
�
·
� 45
2
� 4 / 9
=
� 45
2
� 1 + 4 / 9
=
� 45
2
� 13 / 9
However, upon re-evaluating and using another approach by setting   𝑥 =  2 𝑎 and
𝑦 =  2 𝑏 , we find:
log 𝑥 ( 𝑦 𝑥 )   =  10   = ⇒
𝑥 log 𝑥 𝑦
log 𝑥 𝑦 =  10   = ⇒ 𝑥 ·   4
9   =  10   = ⇒ 𝑥 =   45
2
log 𝑦 ( 𝑥 4 𝑦 )   =  10   = ⇒
4 log 𝑦 𝑥 +  1
log 𝑦 𝑥
=  10   = ⇒ 4 ·   9
4   + 1  =  10   = ⇒ 9 + 1  =  10
consistent
Finally, we find that the product   𝑥𝑦 simplifies to:
𝑥𝑦 =
� 45
2
