Abstract
We introduce DeepSeek-V3.2, a model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with supe-
rior reasoning and agent performance.   The key technical breakthroughs of DeepSeek-V3.2 are as
follows:  (1) DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA) : We introduce DSA, an efficient attention mecha-
nism that substantially reduces computational complexity while preserving model performance
in long-context scenarios.   (2) Scalable Reinforcement Learning Framework :   By implementing
a robust reinforcement learning protocol and scaling post-training compute, DeepSeek-V3.2
performs comparably to GPT-5.   Notably, our high-compute variant, DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale,
surpasses   GPT-5   and   exhibits   reasoning   proficiency   on   par   with   Gemini-3.0-Pro,   achieving
gold-medal  performance in both the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and the
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).  (3) Large-Scale Agentic Task Synthesis Pipeline :
To integrate reasoning into tool-use scenarios, we developed a novel synthesis pipeline that
systematically generates training data at scale.   This methodology facilitates scalable agentic
post-training, yielding substantial improvements in generalization and instruction-following
robustness within complex, interactive environments.

1.   Introduction
The release of reasoning models (DeepSeek-AI, 2025; OpenAI, 2024a) marked a pivotal moment
in   the   evolution   of   Large   Language   Models   (LLMs),   catalyzing   a   substantial   leap   in   overall
performance   across   the   verifiable   fields.   Since   this   milestone,   the   capabilities   of   LLMs   have
advanced   rapidly.   However,   a   distinct   divergence   has   emerged   in   the   past   months.   While
the   open-source   community   (MiniMax,   2025;   MoonShot,   2025;   Qwen,   2025;   ZhiPu-AI,   2025)
continues   to   make   strides,   the   performance   trajectory   of   closed-source   proprietary   models
(Anthropic, 2025b; DeepMind, 2025a; OpenAI, 2025) has accelerated at a significantly steeper rate.
Consequently, rather than converging, the performance gap between closed-source and open-
source models appears to be widening, with proprietary systems demonstrating increasingly
superior capabilities in complex tasks.
Through our analysis, we identify three critical deficiencies that limit the capability of open-
source   models   in   complex   tasks.   First,   architecturally,   the   predominant   reliance   on   vanilla
attention (Vaswani et al., 2017) mechanisms severely constrains efficiency for long sequences.
This inefficiency poses a substantial obstacle to both scalable deployment and effective post-
training.   Second, regarding resource allocation, open-source models suffer from insufficient
computational investment during the post-training phase, limiting their performance on hard
tasks.   Finally, in the context of AI agents, open-source models demonstrate a marked lag in
generalization and instruction-following capabilities compared to their proprietary counterparts
(EvalSys, 2025; Li et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025), hindering their effectiveness in real deployment.
To   address   these   critical   limitations,   we   first   introduce   DSA,   a   highly   efficient   attention
mechanism   designed   to   substantially   reduce   computational   complexity.   This   architecture
effectively   addresses   the   efficiency   bottleneck,   preserving   model   performance   even   in   long-
context scenarios. Second, we develop a stable and scalable RL protocol that allows for significant
computational expansion during the post-training phase.   Notably, this framework allocates a
post-training computational budget exceeding 10% of the pre-training cost, unlocking advanced
capabilities.   Thirdly, we propose a novel pipeline to foster generalizable reasoning in tool-use
scenarios.   First,   we   implement   a   cold-start   phase   utilizing   the   DeepSeek-V3   (DeepSeek-AI,
2024) methodology to unify reasoning and tool-use within single trajectories.   Subsequently, we
advance to large-scale agentic task synthesis, where we generate over 1,800 distinct environments
and 85,000 complex prompts. This extensive synthesized data drives the RL process, significantly
enhancing the model’s generalization and instruction-following capability in the agent context.
DeepSeek-V3.2 achieves similar performance with Kimi-k2-thinking and GPT-5 across mul-
tiple reasoning benchmarks.   Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3.2 significantly advances the agentic
capabilities of open models, demonstrating exceptional proficiency on the long-tail agent tasks
introduced   in   EvalSys   (2025);   Li   et   al.   (2025);   Luo   et   al.   (2025).   DeepSeek-V3.2   emerges   as   a
highly   cost-efficient   alternative   in   agent   scenarios,   significantly   narrowing   the   performance
gap between open and frontier proprietary models while incurring substantially lower costs.
Notably, with the aim of pushing the boundaries of open models in the reasoning domain, we
relaxed the length constraints to develop DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale.   As a result, DeepSeek-V3.2-
Speciale achieves performance parity with the leading closed-source system, Gemini-3.0-Pro
(DeepMind, 2025b).   It shows gold-medal performance in the IOI 2025, ICPC World Final 2025,
IMO 2025, and CMO 2025.

2.   DeepSeek-V3.2 Architecture
2.1.   DeepSeek Sparse Attention
DeepSeek-V3.2   uses   exactly   the   same   architecture   as   DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp.   Compared   with
DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, the last version of DeepSeek-V3.1, the only architectural modification
of DeepSeek-V3.2 is the introduction of DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA) through continued
training.
Prototype of DSA.
The prototype of DSA primarily consists of two components:   a lightning
indexer and a fine-grained token selection mechanism.
The  lightning indexer  computes the index score   𝐼 𝑡 , 𝑠 between the query token  h 𝑡 ∈ R 𝑑 and a
preceding token  h 𝑠 ∈ R 𝑑 , determining which tokens to be selected by the query token:
𝐼 𝑡 , 𝑠 =
𝐻 𝐼
∑︁
𝑗 = 1
𝑤 𝐼
𝑡 , 𝑗 ·  ReLU
�
q 𝐼
𝑡 , 𝑗 ·  k 𝐼
𝑠
�
,
(1)
where   𝐻 𝐼 denotes the number of indexer heads;   q 𝐼
𝑡 , 𝑗 ∈ R 𝑑 𝐼 and   𝑤 𝐼
𝑡 , 𝑗 ∈ R  are derived from the
query token  h 𝑡 ; and  k 𝐼
𝑠 ∈ R 𝑑 𝐼 is derived from the preceding token  h 𝑠 .   We choose ReLU as the
activation function for throughput consideration.   Given that the lightning indexer has a small
number of heads and can be implemented in FP8, its computational efficiency is remarkable.
Given   the   index   scores   { 𝐼 𝑡 , 𝑠 }   for   each   query   token   h 𝑡 ,   our   fine-grained   token   selection
mechanism  retrieves only the key-value entries  { c 𝑠 }  corresponding to the top-k index scores.
Then, the attention output  u 𝑡 is computed by applying the attention mechanism between the
query token  h 𝑡 and the sparsely selected key-value entries  { c 𝑠 } :
u 𝑡 =  Attn � h 𝑡 ,
�
c 𝑠
�� 𝐼 𝑡 , 𝑠 ∈ Top-k �
𝐼 𝑡 ,:
��� .
(2)
Instantiate DSA Under MLA.
For the consideration of continued training from DeepSeek-
V3.1-Terminus, we instantiate DSA based on MLA (DeepSeek-AI, 2024) for DeepSeek-V3.2.   At
the kernel level, each key-value entry must be shared across multiple queries for computational
efficiency (Yuan et al., 2025).   Therefore, we implement DSA based on the MQA (Shazeer, 2019)
mode of MLA 1 , where each latent vector (the key-value entry of MLA) will be shared across
all   query   heads   of   the   query   token.   The   DSA   architecture   based   on   MLA   is   illustrated   in
Figure 2.   We also provide an open-source implementation of DeepSeek-V3.2 2   to specify the
details unambiguously.
2.1.1.   Continued Pre-Training
Starting from a base checkpoint of DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, whose context length has been ex-
tended to 128K, we perform continued pre-training followed by post-training to create DeepSeek-
V3.2.
The continued pre-training of DeepSeek-V3.2 consists of two training stages.   For both stages,
the distribution of training data is totally aligned with the 128K long context extension data
used for DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus.
1 We illustrate the difference between the MQA and MHA modes of MLA in Appendix A.

Dense Warm-up Stage.
We first use a short warm-up stage to initialize the lightning indexer.
In this stage, we keep dense attention and freeze all model parameters except for the lightning
indexer.   To align the indexer outputs with the main attention distribution, for the  𝑡 -th query
token,   we   first   aggregate   the   main   attention   scores   by   summing   across   all   attention   heads.
This sum is then L1-normalized along the sequence dimension to produce a target distribution
𝑝 𝑡 ,:   ∈ R 𝑡 .   Based on   𝑝 𝑡 ,: , we set a KL-divergence loss as the training objective of the indexer:
L 𝐼 =
∑︁
𝑡
D KL
�
𝑝 𝑡 ,:
�� Softmax �
𝐼 𝑡 ,:
�� .
(3)
For warm-up, we use a learning rate of 10 − 3 .   We train the indexer for only 1000 steps, with each
step consisting of 16 sequences of 128K tokens, resulting in a total of 2.1B tokens.
Sparse   Training   Stage.
Following   indexer   warm-up,   we   introduce   the   fine-grained   token
selection   mechanism   and   optimize   all   model   parameters   to   adapt   the   model   to   the   sparse
pattern of DSA. In this stage, we also keep aligning the indexer outputs to the main attention
distribution, but considering only the selected token set  S 𝑡 =
�
𝑠
�� 𝐼 𝑡 , 𝑠 ∈ Top-k �
𝐼 𝑡 ,:
��
:
L 𝐼 =
∑︁
𝑡
D KL
�
𝑝 𝑡 , S 𝑡
�� Softmax �
𝐼 𝑡 , S 𝑡
�� .
(4)
It is worth noting that we detach the indexer input from the computational graph for separate
optimization.   The training signal of the indexer is from only  L 𝐼 , while the optimization of the
main model is according to only the language modeling loss.   In this sparse training stage, we
use a learning rate of 7.3  ×  10 − 6 , and select 2048 key-value tokens for each query token.   We train
both the main model and the indexer for 15000 steps, with each step consisting of 480 sequences
of 128K tokens, resulting in a total of 943.7B tokens.

2.2.   Parity Evaluation
Standard Benchmark
In September 2025, we evaluate DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp on a suite of bench-
marks,   which   focus   on   diverse   capabilities,   and   compare   it   with   DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus
showing similar performance.   While DeepSeek V3.2 Exp significantly improves computational
efficiency on long sequences, we do not observe substantial performance degradation compared
with DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, on both short- and long-context tasks.
Human Preference
Given that direct human preference assessments are inherently suscep-
tible to bias,   we employ ChatbotArena as an indirect evaluation framework to approximate
user   preferences   for   the   newly   developed   base   models.   Both   DeepSeek - V3.1 - Terminus   and
DeepSeek - V3.2 - Exp share an identical post - training strategy, and their Elo scores, obtained from
evaluations conducted on 10 November 2025, are closely matched.   These results suggest that the
new base model achieves performance on par with the previous iteration, despite incorporating
a sparse attention mechanism.
Long Context Eval
Following the release of DeepSeek - V3.2 - Exp, several independent long - context
evaluations were conducted using previously unseen test sets.   A representative benchmark
is   AA - LCR 3 ,   in   which   DeepSeek - V3.2 - Exp   scores   four   points   higher   than   DeepSeek-V3.1-
Terminus   in reasoning mode.   In the Fiction.liveBench evaluation 4 , DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp consis-
tently outperforms DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus   across multiple metrics.   This evidence indicates
the base checkpoint of DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp does not regress on long context tasks.
2.3.   Inference Costs
DSA reduces the core attention complexity of the main model from   O �
𝐿 2 � to   O( 𝐿𝑘 ) ,   where   𝑘
( ≪ 𝐿 ) is the number of selected tokens.   Although the lightning indexer still has a complexity
of  O �
𝐿 2 � , it requires much less computation compared with MLA in DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus.
Combined with our optimized implementation, DSA achieves a significant end-to-end speedup
in long-context scenarios.   Figure 3 presents how token costs of DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus and
DeepSeek-V3.2 vary with the token position in the sequence.   These costs are estimated from
benchmarking the actual service deployed on H800 GPUs, at a rental price of 2 USD per GPU
hour.   Note that for short-sequence prefilling, we specially implement a masked MHA mode to
simulate DSA, which can achieve higher efficiency under short-context conditions.
3.   Post-Training
After continued pre-training, we perform post-training to create the final DeepSeek-V3.2.   The
post-training of DeepSeek-V3.2 also employs sparse attention in the same way as the sparse
continued pre-training stage.   For DeepSeek-V3.2, we maintain the same post-training pipeline
as in DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, which includes specialist distillation and mixed RL training.
Specialist   Distillation
For   each   task,   we   initially   develop   a   specialized   model   dedicated
exclusively to that particular domain, with all specialist models being fine-tuned from the same

pre-trained DeepSeek-V3.2 base checkpoint.   In addition to writing tasks and general question-
answering, our framework encompasses six specialized domains:   mathematics, programming,
general logical reasoning, general agentic tasks, agentic coding, and agentic search, with all the
domains supporting both thinking and non-thinking modes.   Each specialist is trained with large-
scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) computing.   Furthermore, we employ different models to
generate training data for long chain-of-thought reasoning (thinking mode) and direct response
generation   (non-thinking   mode).   Once   the   specialist   models   are   prepared,   they   are   used   to
produce the domain-specific data for the final checkpoint.   Experimental results demonstrate that
models trained on the distilled data achieve performance levels only marginally below those
of domain-specific specialists, with the performance gap being effectively eliminated through
subsequent RL training.
Mixed RL Training
For DeepSeek-V3.2, we still adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)   (DeepSeek-AI,   2025;   Shao   et   al.,   2024)   as   the   RL   training   algorithm.   As   DeepSeek-
V3.2-Exp, we merge reasoning, agent, and human alignment training into one RL stage.   This
approach effectively balances performance across diverse domains while circumventing the
catastrophic forgetting issues commonly associated with multi-stage training paradigms.   For
reasoning and agent tasks, we employ rule-based outcome reward, length penalty, and language
consistency   reward.   For   general   tasks,   we   employ   a   generative   reward   model   where   each
prompt has its own rubrics for evaluation.
DeepSeek-V3.2 and DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale
DeepSeek-V3.2 integrates reasoning, agent, and
human alignment data distilled from specialists, undergoing thousands of steps of continued RL
training to reach the final checkpoints.   To investigate the potential of extended thinking, we also
developed an experimental variant, DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale. This model was trained exclusively
on reasoning data with a reduced length penalty during RL. Additionally, we incorporated the
dataset and reward method from DeepSeekMath-V2 (Shao et al., 2025) to enhance capabilities in
mathematical proofs.
We would like to highlight our efforts in how to create a stable recipe to scale up RL compute
in Section 3.1, and how to integrate thinking into agentic tasks in Section 3.2

3.1.   Scaling GRPO
We first review the objective of GRPO. GRPO optimizes the policy model  𝜋 𝜃 by maximizing the
following objective on a group of responses  { 𝑜 1 ,  · · ·   ,  𝑜 𝐺 }  sampled from the old policy  𝜋 old  given
each question  𝑞 :
J GRPO ( 𝜃 )   =   E 𝑞 ∼ 𝑃 ( 𝑄 ) , { 𝑜 𝑖 } 𝐺
𝑖 = 1 ∼ 𝜋 old (·| 𝑞 )

(6)
is   the   importance   sampling   ratio   between   the   current   and   old   policy.
𝜀 and   𝛽 are   hyper-
parameters   controlling   the   clipping   range   and   KL   penalty   strength,   respectively.
ˆ 𝐴 𝑖 , 𝑡 is   the
advantage of   𝑜 𝑖 , 𝑡 which is estimated by normalizing the outcome reward within each group.
Specifically,   a set of reward models are used to score an outcome reward   𝑅 𝑖 for each output
𝑜 𝑖 in   the   group,   yielding   𝐺 rewards   𝑹 =   { 𝑅 1 ,  · · ·   ,  𝑅 𝐺 }   respectively.   The   advantage   of   𝑜 𝑖 , 𝑡 is
calculated by subtracting the average reward of the group from the reward of output   𝑜 𝑖 , i.e.,
ˆ 𝐴 𝑖 , 𝑡 =  𝑅 𝑖 − mean ( 𝑹 ) .
In the following, we outline additional strategies that stabilize RL scaling, directly building
on the GRPO algorithm.
Unbiased KL Estimate
Given  𝑜 𝑖 , 𝑡 is sampled from the old policy  𝜋 old (·| 𝑞 ,  𝑜 𝑖 , <𝑡 ) , we correct the
K3 estimator (Schulman, 2020) to obtain an unbiased KL estimate using the importance-sampling
ratio between the current policy  𝜋 𝜃 and the old policy  𝜋 old  .
D KL
�
𝜋 𝜃 ( 𝑜 𝑖 , 𝑡 )
�� 𝜋 ref ( 𝑜 𝑖 , 𝑡 ) � =   𝜋 𝜃 ( 𝑜 𝑖 , 𝑡 | 𝑞 ,  𝑜 𝑖 , <𝑡 )
𝜋 old ( 𝑜 𝑖 , 𝑡 | 𝑞 ,  𝑜 𝑖 , <𝑡 )
� 𝜋 ref ( 𝑜 𝑖 , 𝑡 | 𝑞 ,  𝑜 𝑖 , <𝑡 )
𝜋 𝜃 ( 𝑜 𝑖 , 𝑡 | 𝑞 ,  𝑜 𝑖 , <𝑡 )   − log   𝜋 ref ( 𝑜 𝑖 , 𝑡 | 𝑞 ,  𝑜 𝑖 , <𝑡 )
𝜋 𝜃 ( 𝑜 𝑖 , 𝑡 | 𝑞 ,  𝑜 𝑖 , <𝑡 )   − 1
�
.
(7)
As a direct result of this adjustment, the gradient of this KL estimator becomes unbiased,
which   eliminates   systematic   estimation   errors,   thereby   facilitating   stable   convergence.   This
contrasts sharply with the original K3 estimator, particularly when the sampled tokens have
substantially lower probabilities under the current policy than the reference policy, i.e.,  𝜋 𝜃 ≪ 𝜋 ref .
In such cases, the gradient of the K3 estimator assigns disproportionately large, unbounded
weights to maximize the likelihood of these tokens, resulting in noisy gradient updates that
accumulate to degrade sample quality in subsequent iterations and lead to unstable training
dynamics.   In   practice,   we   find   that   different   domains   benefit   from   varying   strengths   of   KL
regularization.   For certain domains, such as mathematics, applying a relatively weak KL penalty
or even omitting it entirely can yield improved performance.
Off-Policy Sequence Masking
To improve the efficiency of RL systems, we typically generate
a large batch of rollout data, which is subsequently split into multiple mini-batches for several
gradient update steps.   This practice inherently introduces off-policy behavior.   Additionally,
inference frameworks used for efficient data generation are often highly optimized, which may
differ in implementation details from training frameworks. Such training-inference inconsistency
7

<!-- Page 8 -->

further exacerbates the degree of off-policyness.   To stabilize training and improve tolerance for
off-policy updates, we mask negative sequences that introduce significant policy divergence, as
measured by the KL divergence between the data-sampling policy  𝜋 old  and the current policy
𝜋 𝜃 .   More specifically, we introduce a binary mask   𝑀 into the GRPO loss:

otherwise,
(9)
and   𝛿 is   a   hyper-parameter   that   controls   the   threshold   of   policy   divergence.   Note   that   𝜋 old
here denotes the sampling probability directly returned by the inference framework, thus the
KL divergence between the old and current policy accounts for both sources of off-policyness
mentioned above.   It is also worth noting that we only mask sequences with negative advantages.
Intuitively, the model benefits the most by learning from its own mistakes, whereas highly
off-policy   negative   samples   can   be   detrimental,   potentially   misleading   or   destabilizing   the
optimization process.   We empirically observe that this Off-Policy Sequence Masking operation
improves stability in certain training scenarios that would otherwise exhibit instability.
Keep Routing
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve computational efficiency by activat-
ing only a subset of expert modules during inference.   However, discrepancies between inference
and   training   frameworks,   compounded   by   policy   updates,   can   result   in   inconsistent   expert
routing during inference and training even for identical inputs.   Such inconsistency induces
abrupt shifts in the active parameter subspace, which destabilizes optimization and exacerbates
off-policy issues.   To mitigate this, we preserve the expert routing paths used during sampling
in the inference framework and enforce the same routing paths during training, ensuring that
identical expert parameters are optimized.   This Keep Routing operation was found crucial for
RL training stability of MoE models, and has been adopted in our RL training pipeline since
DeepSeek-V3-0324.
Keep   Sampling   Mask
Top-p   and   top-k   sampling   are   widely   used   sampling   strategies   to
enhance the quality of responses generated by LLMs.   Employing these strategies in RL training
is also advantageous, as it avoids sampling extremely low-probability tokens that would be
used as optimization targets.   While such truncation preserves sample quality, it introduces a
mismatch between the action spaces of  𝜋 old  and  𝜋 𝜃 , which violates the principles of importance
sampling and destabilizes training.   To address this, we preserve the truncation masks during
sampling from  𝜋 old  and apply them to  𝜋 𝜃 during training, ensuring both policies share identical
action subspaces.   Empirically, we find that combining top-p sampling with the Keep Sampling
Mask strategy effectively preserves language consistency during RL training.

3.2.   Thinking in Tool-Use
3.2.1.   Thinking Context Management
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated that incorporating a thinking process can significantly enhance
a   model’s   ability   to   solve   complex   problems.   Building   on   this   insight,   we   aim   to   integrate
thinking capabilities into tool-calling scenarios.
We observed that replicating DeepSeek-R1’s strategy—discarding reasoning content upon the
arrival of the second round of messages—results in significant token inefficiency.   This approach
forces   the   model   to   redundantly   re-reason   through   the   entire   problem   for   each   subsequent
tool call.   To mitigate this, we developed a context management strictly tailored for tool-calling
scenarios as shown in Fig 4:
•   Historical reasoning content is discarded only when a new  user message  is introduced
to the conversation.   If only tool-related messages (e.g., tool outputs) are appended, the
reasoning content is  retained  throughout the interaction.
•   When reasoning traces are removed, the history of  tool calls and their results  remains
preserved in the context.
Notably, certain agent frameworks, such as Roo Code or Terminus, simulate tool interactions
via   user   messages.   These   frameworks   may   not   fully   benefit   from   our   enhanced   reasoning
persistence due to the context management rules outlined above.   Therefore, we recommend
utilizing non-thinking models for optimal performance with such architectures.
Figure 4  |  Thinking retention mechanism in tool-calling scenarios.
3.2.2.   Cold-Start
Given the availability of reasoning data (non-agentic) and non-reasoning agentic data, a straight-
forward strategy for integrating these two capabilities is through carefully designed prompting.
We posit that the model possesses sufficient ability to accurately follow explicit instructions,
thereby enabling the seamless incorporation of tool execution within the reasoning process.
9

---


<!-- Page 10 -->

To demonstrate the operation of the cold-start mechanism, we selectively sample the training
data as shown in Appendix Tables 6–8.   It is important to note that distinct task prompts are
associated with different system prompts.   Tables 6–8 present an illustrative example correspond-
ing to a competitive programming prompt.   Table 6 presents an example of our reasoning data,
which uses a system prompt to explicitly asks the model to do reasoning before the final answer
and uses a special tag <think></think> to label the reasoning path.   Table 7 shows the prompt
of non-reasoning agentic data, where the system prompt contains the guidance of toolcall.   Table
8 presents the system prompt we designed to instruct the model to incorporate multiple tool
calls within its reasoning process.
In this manner, although the reasoning in tool - use patterns may lack robustness, the model
is occasionally able to generate the desired trajectories, thereby providing a basis for subsequent
reinforcement learning stages.
3.2.3.   Large-Scale Agentic Tasks
A diverse set of RL tasks is crucial for enhancing model robustness.   For tasks such as search,
code engineering, and code interpretation, we employ real-world tools, including actual web
search APIs, coding tools, and Jupyter Notebooks.   While these RL environments are real, the
prompts employed are either extracted from Internet sources or synthetically generated, rather
than obtained from actual user interactions.   For other tasks, the environment and prompts are
both synthetically constructed.   The agent tasks we used are described in Table 1.
Table 1  |  The description of different agent tasks, including the number of tasks, environment
type (real or synthesized), and prompt source (extracted or synthesized).
Search Agent
We employ a multi-agent pipeline based on DeepSeek-V3.2 to generate diverse,
high-quality training data.   We first sample informative long-tail entities across diverse domains
from large-scale web corpora.   A question-construction agent then explores each entity using
search   tools   with   configurable   depth   and   breadth   parameters,   consolidating   the   discovered
information   into   question-answer   pairs.   Multiple   answer-generation   agents   with   heteroge-
neous configurations (different checkpoints, system prompts, etc.)   produce diverse candidate
responses for each proposed QA pair.   A verification agent with search capabilities validates
all answers through multiple passes, retaining only samples where the ground-truth is correct
and all candidates are verifiably incorrect.   These data spans multiple languages, domains, and
difficulty levels.   To complement these verifiable samples and better reflect real-world usage,
we also augment the dataset with filtered instances from our existing helpful RL datasets, for
which the search tool provides measurable benefits.   We then develop detailed evaluation rubrics
across multiple quality dimensions and employ a generative reward model to score responses
based on these rubrics.   This hybrid approach enables optimization for both factual reliability
and practical helpfulness.

Code Agent
We constructed large-scale, executable environments for software issue resolution
by mining millions of issue-Pull Request (PR) pairs from GitHub.   This dataset was rigorously
filtered using heuristic rules and LLM-based judgments to ensure high quality, requiring that
each entry contain a reasonable issue description, a correlated gold patch, and a test patch for
validation.   An automated environment-setup agent, powered by DeepSeek-V3.2, was employed
to build executable environments for these pairs.   This agent handles package installation, de-
pendency resolution, and test execution.   Test results are output in the standard JUnit format,
ensuring consistent parsing across programming languages and test frameworks.   An environ-
ment is deemed successfully built only when applying the gold patch results in a non-zero count
of false-to-positive (F2P) test cases (indicating the issue is fixed) and a zero count of pass-to-fail
(P2F) test cases (indicating no regressions).   Using this pipeline, we successfully built tens of
thousands   of   reproducible   issue   resolution   environments   spanning   multiple   programming
languages, including Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Go, and PHP.
Code Interpreter Agent
We utilize Jupyter Notebook as a code interpreter to address complex
reasoning tasks.   To facilitate this, we curate a diverse set of problems spanning mathematics,
logic, and data science, each requiring the model to leverage code execution capabilities to arrive
at a solution.
General   Agent
To   scale   up   agent   environments   and   tasks   in   RL,   we   employ   an   automatic
environment-synthesis agent that synthesizes 1,827 task-oriented environments.   These tasks are
hard to solve but easy to verify.   The synthesis workflow primarily consists of environment and
toolset construction, task synthesis, and solution generation.   Specifically, the workflow proceeds
as follows.
1.   Given a task category (e.g., planning a travel itinerary) and a sandbox equipped with a
bash and a search tool, the agent first uses these tools to generate or retrieve relevant data
from the Internet and store them in the sandbox database.
2.   The agent then synthesizes a set of task-specific tools, each implemented as a function.
3.   To create tasks that are both challenging and automatically verifiable, the agent initially
proposes a simple task based on the current database, along with its solution and verifica-
tion functions implemented in Python.   The solution function is restricted to invoking tool
functions or performing logical computations, and cannot call other functions or directly
access the database, ensuring the task can only be solved through the tool interface.   Addi-
tionally, the results produced by the solution function must be validated by the verification
function.   If the solution is not validated, the agent will modify the solution or verification
functions until the solution’s output passes the verification.   The agent then iteratively
increases the difficulty of the task and updates the corresponding solution and verification
functions.   During this iterative process, if the current toolset is not sufficient to solve the
task, the agent will augment the toolset.
Following this workflow, we obtain thousands of  < environment ,  tools ,  task ,  verifier >  tuples.
We then perform RL on this dataset using DeepSeek-V3.2 and retain only instances with non-zero
pass@100, resulting in 1,827 environments and their corresponding tasks (4,417 in total).   A syn-
thetic trip-planning example is illustrated below.   This example highlights that, while searching
the large combinatorial space for a trip plan that satisfies all constraints is challenging, checking
whether a given candidate solution satisfies these constraints is relatively straightforward.

An Example of Synthesized Task:   Trip Planning
I’m   planning   a   three-day   trip   starting   from   Hangzhou,   and   I   need   help   creating   an   itinerary
from October 1st to October 3rd,   2025.   A few important requirements:   I don’t want to repeat
any cities, hotels, attractions, or restaurants during the entire trip.   Also, please make sure that
every   hotel,   restaurant,   and   attraction   you   recommend   is   actually   located   in   the   city   where
I’ll   be   staying   that   day.   One   more   thing   about   the   second   day   -   I’m   trying   to   be   smart   about
my   budget.   If   I   end   up   booking   a   luxury   hotel   that   costs   800   CNY   or   more   per   night,   then   I
need   to   be   more   careful   with   other   expenses:   my   total   spending   on   both   restaurants   (lunch
and   dinner)   should   stay   under   350   CNY,   both   restaurants   should   be   rated   at   least   4.0   stars,
and   the   afternoon   attraction   ticket   needs   to   be   less   than   120   CNY.   If   the   hotel   on   day   2   is   in
the   mid-to-high   range   (500-800   CNY),   then   I   have   a   bit   more   flexibility   -   I   just   need   to   make
sure at least one of my restaurant choices is rated 4.0 or higher, and the attraction ticket should
be   below   180   CNY.   For   more   affordable   hotels   (200-500   CNY   range),   I   only   need   to   ensure
that at least one restaurant has a rating of 3.2 or above. Can you help me put together this itinerary?

DeepSeek-V3.2 achieves similar performance with GPT-5-high on reasoning tasks, but is
slightly worse than Gemini-3.0-Pro.   Compared to K2-Thinking, DeepSeek-V3.2 achieves compa-
rable scores with substantially fewer output tokens, as shown in Table 3.   These performance
gains can be attributed to the increased computational resources allocated to RL training.   Over
recent months, we have observed consistent performance improvements correlating with ex-
tended RL training budget, which already exceeds 10% of the pre-training cost.   We hypothesize
that reasoning capabilities could be further enhanced with additional computational budget al-
location.   Notably, the performance of DeepSeek-V3.2 presented herein is constrained by a length
constraint reward model; upon removal of the restriction, we observe further improvement in

model performance, as detailed in Section 4.2.
In code agent evaluations, DeepSeek-V3.2 significantly outperforms open-source LLMs on
both SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench 2.0, demonstrating its potential within real-world
coding workflows.   Regarding Terminal Bench 2.0, as previously noted, our context management
strategy for the ’thinking mode’ is currently incompatible with Terminus;   consequently,   the
reported   score   of   46.4   was   achieved   using   the   Claude   Code   framework.   We   also   evaluated
DeepSeek-V3.2 with Terminus in non-thinking mode, yielding a score of 39.3.   For SWE-bench
Verified, the primary score was obtained using our internal framework.   Robustness tests across
other settings—including the Claude Code and RooCode frameworks, as well as non-thinking
mode—produced consistent results, ranging from 72 to 74.
For the search agent evaluation, we assess our models using a standard commercial search
API. Since DeepSeek-V3.2 supports a maximum context length of only 128K, approximately
20%+   of   the   test   cases   exceed   this   limit.   To   address   this,   we   employ   a   context   management
method to derive the final score.   For reference, the score is 51.4 without context management.
Further details are provided in Section 4.4.
On tool-use benchmarks, DeepSeek-V3.2 substantially narrows the performance gap between
open-source and closed-source LLMs, though it remains below frontier models.   For  𝜏 2 -bench,
we employ the model itself as the user agent, achieving final category scores of 63.8 (Airline),
81.1 (Retail),   and 96.2 (Telecom).   For the MCP benchmarks,   we employ the function calling
format   and   place   tool   outputs   within   messages   designated   with   the   ’tool’   role,   rather   than
the   ’user’   role.   During   our   testing,   we   observed   that   DeepSeek-V3.2   frequently   engages   in
redundant self-verification, generating excessively long trajectories.   This tendency often causes
the context length to exceed the 128K limit, particularly in tasks such as MCP-Mark GitHub
and   Playwright   evaluation.   Consequently,   this   phenomenon   hinders   the   final   performance
of DeepSeek-V3.2.   However, integrating context management strategies can further enhance
performance.   We identify this as a direction for future work and a practical consideration for
users.   Even if DeepSeek-V3.2 suffers from the issue, it still significantly outperforms existing
open models.   Notably, since the environments and toolsets employed in these benchmarks were
not encountered during RL training, the observed improvements demonstrate DeepSeek-V3.2’s
capacity to generalize its reasoning strategies to out-of-domain agentic scenarios.   The evaluation
of non-thinking model in the agent scenario is shown in Appendix Table 9.
4.2.   Results of DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale
Table 3 demonstrates that DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale achieves superior performance by leveraging
increased   reasoning   tokens,   surpassing   the   state-of-the-art   Gemini-3.0-Pro   across   multiple
benchmarks.   Remarkably, as shown in Table 4, this general-purpose model attains gold-medal
level performance in the 2025 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) and the ICPC World
Finals (ICPC WF) without targeted training.   Furthermore, by incorporating techniques from
Shao   et   al.   (2025),   the   model   excels   in   complex   proof   tasks,   reaching   gold-medal   thresholds
in the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and China Mathematical Olympiad
(CMO) 5 . Detailed evaluation protocols are provided in Appendix D.
However, the token efficiency of DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale remains significantly inferior to
that of Gemini-3.0-Pro.   To mitigate deployment costs and latency, we imposed stricter token
constraints during the training of the official DeepSeek-V3.2, aiming to optimize the trade-off

4.3.   Synthesis Agentic Tasks
In this section, we perform ablation experiments to study the effect of synthetic agentic tasks.
We focus on two questions.   First, are synthetic tasks sufficiently challenging for reinforcement
learning?   Second, how well do these synthetic tasks generalize, i.e., can they transfer to different
downstream tasks or real-world environments?
To address the first question, we randomly sample 50 instances from the general synthesized
agentic tasks and evaluate both the model used for synthesis and frontier closed-source LLMs.
As shown in Table 5, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp attains an accuracy of only 12%, while frontier closed-
source models achieve at most 62%.   These results indicate that the synthetic data include agentic
tasks that are challenging for both DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp and frontier closed-source models.
To investigate whether RL on synthetic data can generalize to different tasks or real-world
environments, we apply RL to the SFT checkpoint of DeepSeek-V3.2   (denoted DeepSeek-V3.2-
SFT). To exclude the effects of long CoT and other RL data, we conduct RL only on synthetic
agentic   tasks   in   non-thinking   mode.   We   then   compare   the   model   with   DeepSeek-V3.2-SFT
and DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, where DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp is trained with RL only in search and code
environments.   As shown in Figure 5, large-scale RL on synthetic data yields substantial improve-

contrast, restricting RL to code and search scenarios does not improve performance on these
benchmarks, further highlighting the potential of synthetic data.
4.4.   Context Management of Search Agent
Even with extended context windows such as 128k, agentic workflows, particularly in search-
based scenarios, frequently encounter maximum length limitations that prematurely truncate
the reasoning process.   This bottleneck inhibits the full realization of test-time compute potential.
To address this, we introduce context management employing simple strategies to extend token
budgets at test time ， when the token usage exceeds 80% of the context window length.   These
strategies include (1)  Summary , which summarizes the overflowed trajectory and re-initiates
the rollout; (2)  Discard-75% , which discards the first 75% tool call history in the trajectory to
free   up   spaces;   (3)   Discard-all ,   which   resets   the   context   by   discarding   all   previous   tool   call
history (similar to the new context tool (Anthropic, 2025a)).   For comparison, we also implement
a parallel scaling baseline,  Parallel-fewest-step , which samples N independent trajectories and

selects the trajectory with the fewest steps.
We evaluate these strategies on the BrowseComp benchmark (Wei et al., 2025).   As illustrated
in Figure 6, under varying compute budgets, context management leads to significant perfor-
mance gains by allowing the model to scale up test-time compute,   providing more space to
perform additional execution steps.   For example, Summary extends the average steps to 364,
achieving a performance improvement of up to 60.2.   However, its overall efficiency is relatively
low.   Despite its simplicity, Discard-all performs well in both efficiency and scalability, achieving
a score of 67.6, comparable to parallel scaling while using significantly fewer steps.
In summary, test-time compute can be scaled either serially through context management
or   in   parallel,   both   effectively   extending   the   model’s   problem-solving   capacity.   However,
different strategies exhibit varying efficiency and scalability.   Thus, it is crucial to account for
actual compute costs when benchmarking model performance.   Meanwhile, finding the optimal
combination of serial and parallel scaling to maximize both efficiency and scalability remains a
crucial direction for future work.
5.   Conclusion, Limitation, and Future Work
In this work, we introduced DeepSeek-V3.2, a framework that effectively bridges the gap be-
tween computational efficiency and advanced reasoning capabilities.   Using DSA, we addressed
critical computation complexity without sacrificing long-context performance.   By increasing
computational budget, DeepSeek-V3.2 achieves comparable performance with GPT-5 on rea-
soning benchmarks.   Finally, the integration of our large-scale agentic task synthesis pipeline
significantly enhances tool-use proficiency, unlocking new possibilities for robust and generaliz-
able AI agents with open LLM. Furthermore, our high-compute variant, DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale,
validated by gold-medal achievements in the IMO and IOI, sets a milestone for open LLMs.
Despite these achievements, we acknowledge certain limitations when compared to frontier
closed-source   models   such   as   Gemini-3.0-Pro.   First,   due   to   fewer   total   training   FLOPs,   the
breadth   of   world   knowledge   in   DeepSeek-V3.2   still   lags   behind   that   of   leading   proprietary

models. We plan to address this knowledge gap in future iterations by scaling up the pre-training
compute.   Second, token efficiency remains a challenge; DeepSeek-V3.2 typically requires longer
generation trajectories (i.e., more tokens) to match the output quality of models like Gemini-
3.0-Pro.   Future work will focus on optimizing the intelligence density of the model’s reasoning
chains to improve efficiency.   Third, solving complex tasks is still inferior to frontier models,
motivating us to further refine our foundation model and post-training recipe.

Table 6   |   An example of the reasoning data system prompt.   The system prompt requires the
model to output the reasoning process in the tag <think></think>.
Table 7  |  {TOOL-DESCRIPTIONS} and {TOOLCALL-FORMAT} will be replaced with the specific
tools and our designed toolcall format.
Table 8  |  The model executes tool calls in thinking process.

| Reasoning System Prompt | You are an expert Python programmer. You will be given a question (problem specification) and will generate a correct Python program that matches the spec- ification and passes all tests. Please first reason before giving the final answer. The reasoning process enclosed within <think> </think>. The final answer is output after the </think> tag. |

| Prompt | Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head ... |
| Reasoning Response | <think> ... </think> [FINAL ANSWER] |



| Agent System Prompt | Use Python interpreter tool to execute Python code. The code will not be shown to the user. This tool should be used for internal reasoning, but not for code that is intended to be visible to the user (e.g. when creating plots, tables, or files). When you send a message containing Python code to python, it will be executed in a stateful Jupyter notebook environment. python will respond with the output of the execution or time out after 120.0 seconds. ## Tools You have access to the following tools: {TOOL-DESCRIPTIONS} Important: ALWAYS adhere to this exact format for tool use: {TOOLCALL-FORMAT} |

| Reasoning Required Agent System Prompt | You are a helpful assistant with access to a Python interpreter. - You may use the Python tool **multiple times** during your reasoning, a.k.a in <think></think>, with a maximum of 20 code executions. - Call the Python tool early in your reasoning to aid in solving the task. Continue reasoning and invoking tools as needed until you reach the final answer. Once you have the answer, stop reasoning and present your solution using Markdown and LaTeX. - Do NOT invoke any tools in your presented final solution steps. - To improve effciiency and accuracy, you should prefer code execution over language-based reasoning whenever possible. Keep your reasoning succinct; let the code do the heavy lifting. ## Tools You have access to the following tools: {TOOL-DESCRIPTIONS} Important: ALWAYS adhere to this exact format for tool use: {TOOLCALL-FORMAT} |

D.   Evaluation Method of IOI, ICPC World Final, IMO, and CMO
For all competitions, the model’s maximum generation length is set to 128k.   No tools or internet
access are used, and testing strictly adheres to the contest’s time and attempt limits.
For the IOI evaluation, we designed our submission strategy in accordance with the official
competition rules, which permit up to 50 submissions per problem and score each submission
based on the maximum points achieved across all subtasks.   Specifically, we first sampled 500
candidate solutions for each problem, then applied a multi-stage filtering pipeline.   In the initial
stage, we eliminated invalid submissions that failed to pass the provided sample test cases or
exceeded the length constraints.   Subsequently, we employed the DeepSeek-V32-Exp model to
identify and remove samples in which the model explicitly indicated an inability or refusal to
solve the problem.   From the remaining valid candidates, we selected the 50 samples with the
longest thinking traces for final submission.
For the ICPC evaluation,   we adapted the same filtering methodology but with a smaller
initial sample size.   We generated 32 candidate solutions per problem and applied the identical
filtering criteria to select submissions.
In the IMO and CMO tasks, we employ a generate-verify-refine loop.   The model iteratively
improves its solution until it achieves a perfect self-evaluation or hits the maximum revision
cap, identical to the process in Shao et al. (2025).
